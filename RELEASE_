RELEASE NOTES for MHonArc

    Please read the release notes before executing MHonArc.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
* (See also Beta User Notes below if you were a user of 1.0.0 beta)

The release notes for version 1.0.0 of MHonArc address compatiblity
issues with the mail2html 3.1.x program.

	o  The database file is compatible with mail2html database
	   files, however the icon support feature will not work
	   properly.  Recreate the archive with MHonArc if icon usage
	   is desired.

	o  The database filename has been renamed to ".mhonarc.db".
	   HOWEVER, MHonArc will use the ".mail2html.db" file when
	   adding to archives created with mail2html.

	o  Many of the index page resource settings have been eliminated,
	   like DATE and SUBONLY.  The same effects can be obtained by
	   using the LITEMPLATE resource element.

	o  The STAMP resource has been eliminated since the same effect
	   can be achieve with the LISTBEGIN or LISTEND resource elements.

	o  The USERSUBS resource element has been eliminated.  You can
	   achieve the same results by writing your own MIME filter, or
	   modifying the existing ones.


1.0.0 Beta User Notes
---------------------

	o  The number of library files have been reduced (beta 8).  The
	   library 'mhexternal.pl' is a merging of the application,
	   audio, image, and video libraries.  mhexternal.pl covers all
	   the content-types in the old filters, plus much more.  The
	   library is designed to be a catch-all library for
	   content-types that get filtered to external files.

	   **IMPORTANT NOTE:  Because of the change in libraries, any
	   archive database files created with beta version less than 8
	   will cause MHonArc to abort abnormally:  i.e.  Perl aborts
	   because it cannot require the libraries specified in the
	   database file.  You can utilize the file deffilters.rc in
	   the examples directory, with the -rcfile option, to update
	   the database when adding new mail.

	o  The PERLINC resource element is recognized (beta 8).  The
	   docs used PERLINC, but the code used PERLLIB.  Also, the
	   paths specified in the PERLINC resource element are saved
	   to the database.

	o  The default filter libraries' filenames have been renamed to
	   14 characters, or less (beta 5).  This is to avoid conflicts
	   with older Unix file systems with filename limits.  See
	   **IMPORTANT NOTE above about the effects of library filename
	   changes.

	o  The default filters had a bug fixed in them (beta 5).
	   Content-Description text is now properly "htmlized".

	o  The $CURDATE$ variable went away for the LISTBEGIN or
	   LISTEND resource elements (beta 3).  Use $GMTDATE$ to get
	   the current date based off GMT time, and use $LOCALDATE$ to
	   get the local date and time for your timezone.  $CURDATE$
	   used to give only the GMT date and time.
