		  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS for MHonArc
		  ----------------------------
		   <http://www.mhonarc.org/>

I would like to thank everyone who has given feedback on MHonArc.
Sorry for not listing everyone, but it has become too hard to keep
track of all the names.  However, I'd like to give special thanks to
the following:

      [If you know of someone left out that deserves mentioning,
       please send a message to mhonarc(AT)mhonarc.org.]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A. P. Barrett <barrett AT ee DOT und DOT ac DOT za>
	For developing a base64 library in pure Perl.  The library has
	been adapted (with optimizations) to decode base64 messages
	by MHonArc.
        NOTE: Later releases leverage MIME::Base64 module if available
        for best performance due to its native implementation.

 A.R. Burgers <burgers AT ecn DOT nl>
	For contributing the prsfrom.pl program (included in the
	extras/ directory).

 Susie Blackstock <seads AT rsn DOT hp DOT com>
	For helping me with the documentation.  Any problems with the
	documentation is purely my fault.  And she's cute too.

 Achim Bohnet <ach AT rosat DOT mpe-garching DOT mpg DOT de>
	For his help in testing, and contributing to, mhonarc and for
	setting up, and maintaining, the first mhonarc mailing list
	and archive.

 Jeff Breidenbach <jeff AT jab DOT org>
	For his feedback and his usage of MHonArc at a scale that it
	was really never designed for, <http://www.mail-archive.com/>,
	that influenced the development MHonArc (which still has
	scalability problems :-)

 Steven M. Christey <coley AT linus DOT mitre DOT org>
	For performing a security audit on MHonArc source to help
	improve the security of MHonArc and to increase the awareness
	of security issues when developing MHonArc.

 Roman Czyborra <czyborra AT cs DOT tu-berlin DOT de>
	For his help with the MosaicMail script (which has been
	removed in later releases since Mosaic is dead software).

 Brian Foster <Brian.Foster AT ireland DOT sun DOT com>
	For his useful, detailed, bug reports.

 Timothy Finin <Tim.Finin AT cs DOT umbc DOT edu>
	Whose initial feedback on mbox2html (my first mail->HTML
	program) which caused the ball rolling on developing a more
	complete mail-to-HTML program.

 Stephen Franklin <franklin AT uci DOT edu>
	For providing the machine facilities
	for housing the first MHonArc home page:
	<http://www.nacs.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html>.
	Location still functions as a primary mirror/backup for MHonArc.

 Ken Harward
	For helping me tackle Perl problems and for bouncing ideas
	off during the early days.

 Phyllis Imperatrice
	For the initial sketch of the MHonArc logo.

 Eddie Kohler <kohler AT aciri DOT org>
	Provided useful set of patches and ideas to spark
	improvements in index ordering, thread slice formatting, and
	other features.

 Christoper Lindsey <lindsey AT mallorn DOT com>
	For providing hosting services for mhonarc.org and for
	taking over administration responsibilities of the mhonarc
	mailing list.

 Frank J. Manion <FJ_Manion AT fccc DOT edu>
	For his contributions in improving date parsing.

 Steve Pacenka <sp17 AT cornell DOT edu>
	For his great help in getting MHonArc to run under MS-DOS, and
	for his help in trouble-shooting.

 Achille Petrilli <Achille.Petrilli AT MACMAIL DOT CERN DOT CH>
	For his initial patches for MacPerl support.

 John C. Ring, Jr. <jcring AT switch DOT com>
	For tipping me off on how <img src> can be used by spammers,
	which lead to updates in mhtxthtml.pl to address this abuse.

 Olivier Salaün <olivier.salaun AT cru DOT fr>
	For providing test case that consistantly caused perl
	to crash when MHonArc processes HTML messages.  Crash due
	to regex engine bug exposed by the HTML comment declaration
	stripping expression.  This problem could be culprit
	to mysterious stale archive locks reported by some users
	in the past.  Code changed to avoid bug.

 NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe AT mri DOT co DOT jp>
	For the initial contribution of a text/plain filter,
	iso2022jp.pl to process ISO-2022 (Japanese) encoded
        mail messages.
