---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following are release notes from previous versions of MHonArc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.2
-------------

This version is a minor enhancement, bug fix release.  See the CHANGES
files for what was added and fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.1
-------------

This version is a minor enhancement, bug fix release.  See the CHANGES
files for what was added and fixed.


Version 1.2.0
-------------

The CHANGES file contains information on the changes that may affect
1.1.0 archives.  Please read it.


Version 1.1.0
-------------

Database file:
	1.1.0 is able to handle 1.0.x database files.  Only additions
	have been made between 1.0.x and 1.1.0.

Threading:

	o  If you have a 1.0 archive, you can generate a thread index
	   for it with the following:

		mhonarc -thread -editidx ...

	   NOTE:  You will also need to (re)specify the LISTBEGIN
	   resource so a link to the thread index exists on the main
	   index page.  See the section on _Index Page Customization_
	   in the documentation for more information.

	o  You can prevent the creation of the thread index by the
	   following:
	   
		*  Set the M2H_THREAD environment variable to 0.
		*  Specify the NOTHREAD resource file element.
		*  Use the -nothread option.

	o  Remember, the thread index does not replace the main index.
	   It compliments the main index.  If using a custom layout,
	   resource variables are available to link between the 2
	   indexes.


The following note is only relevant if you have developed your own
MIME filters for use in MHonArc:

	o  MHonArc now treats the return value from MIME filters as
	   an array.  The first value of the array is treated as the
	   HTML text to use in the message.  All other array values are
	   treated as names of files that the filter may have generated
	   (eg. mhexternal.pl).  MHonArc stores the filenames in the
	   database.  Therefore, MHonArc can delete any extra files
	   associated with a message if the message is removed via the
	   -rmm option.


Version 1.0.0
-------------
* (See also Beta User Notes below if you were a user of 1.0.0 beta)

The release notes for version 1.0.0 of MHonArc address compatiblity
issues with the mail2html 3.1.x program.

	o  The database file is compatible with mail2html database
	   files, however the icon support feature will not work
	   properly.  Recreate the archive with MHonArc if icon usage
	   is desired.

	o  The database filename has been renamed to ".mhonarc.db".
	   HOWEVER, MHonArc will use the ".mail2html.db" file when
	   adding to archives created with mail2html.

	o  Many of the index page resource settings have been eliminated,
	   like DATE and SUBONLY.  The same effects can be obtained by
	   using the LITEMPLATE resource element.

	o  The STAMP resource has been eliminated since the same effect
	   can be achieve with the LISTBEGIN or LISTEND resource elements.

	o  The USERSUBS resource element has been eliminated.  You can
	   achieve the same results by writing your own MIME filter, or
	   modifying the existing ones.


1.0.0 Beta User Notes
---------------------

	o  The number of library files have been reduced (beta 8).  The
	   library 'mhexternal.pl' is a merging of the application,
	   audio, image, and video libraries.  mhexternal.pl covers all
	   the content-types in the old filters, plus much more.  The
	   library is designed to be a catch-all library for
	   content-types that get filtered to external files.

	   **IMPORTANT NOTE:  Because of the change in libraries, any
	   archive database files created with beta version less than 8
	   will cause MHonArc to abort abnormally:  i.e.  Perl aborts
	   because it cannot require the libraries specified in the
	   database file.  You can utilize the file deffilters.rc in
	   the examples directory, with the -rcfile option, to update
	   the database when adding new mail.

	o  The PERLINC resource element is recognized (beta 8).  The
	   docs used PERLINC, but the code used PERLLIB.  Also, the
	   paths specified in the PERLINC resource element are saved
	   to the database.

	o  The default filter libraries' filenames have been renamed to
	   14 characters, or less (beta 5).  This is to avoid conflicts
	   with older Unix file systems with filename limits.  See
	   **IMPORTANT NOTE above about the effects of library filename
	   changes.

	o  The default filters had a bug fixed in them (beta 5).
	   Content-Description text is now properly "htmlized".

	o  The $CURDATE$ variable went away for the LISTBEGIN or
	   LISTEND resource elements (beta 3).  Use $GMTDATE$ to get
	   the current date based off GMT time, and use $LOCALDATE$ to
	   get the local date and time for your timezone.  $CURDATE$
	   used to give only the GMT date and time.
