Release Notes for MHonArc
=========================
<http://www.mhonarc.org/>

Read the CHANGES document for changes that may affect you if you are
a user of an earlier version of MHonArc.

===========================================================================

  ==>	IMPORTANT IF UPGRADING FROM v2.1.x OR EARLIER:
    
	If you have archives created with v2.1.x, or earlier, you
	must update the archives before using versions v2.2, or
	later.

	To update your archives, you use the mha-dbedit program
	using the def-mime.mrc in the examples directory.  For example:

	    mha-dbedit -rcfile examples/def-mime.mrc \
		       -outdir /path/to/archive

	Make sure that the mhonarc you are using is v2.2, or later.
	Change the -rcfile and -outdir pathnames to reflect where
	you are running mhonarc and where your archive is located,
	respectively.

	Note, if your archives are using custom settings of
	MIMEFILTERS, MIMEARGS, and/or CHARSETCONVERTERS resources,
	you will need to create a variant version of def-mime.mrc
	(included in the examples directory) to include your settings
	and use the variant version when updating your archives.

  ==>	If upgrading from v2.1.x, or earlier, any custom filters you
	have developed may need to modified.  If your filter accessed
	some main variables, your filter will not operate properly.
	All variables that used to be in package "main" are no longer.
	The major variables are now in package "mhonarc".  For example,
	$::OUTDIR is now $mhonarc::OUTDIR.  See the MIMEFILTERS
	resource page for more information.

  ==>	See the Warnings in the documentation for the HTMLEXT and
	MSGPREFIX resources before using them.

  ==>	Occasionally, a new release of MHonArc may contain new
	MIME filters.  See the CHANGES file to check if any new filters
	have been added.

	If you confirm that new filters have been added, and you want
	to apply them to your archives, you use the mha-dbedit program
	using the def-mime.mrc in the examples directory.  For example:

	    mha-dbedit -rcfile examples/def-mime.mrc \
		       -outdir /path/to/archive

	Note, if your archives are using custom settings of
	MIMEFILTERS, MIMEARGS, and/or CHARSETCONVERTERS resources,
	you will need to create a variant version of def-mime.mrc
	(included in the examples directory) to include your settings
	and use the variant version when updating your archives.
