Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please do the following:

  • Make sure it is not a usage problem: check the documentation and FAQ.
  • Check that you are running the latest version of MHonArc. If not, it is
    likely the problem has been fixed in a newer version.
  • If you are not sure if the problem is a bug or not, send a message to
    the mailing list to get confirmation.

The prefered way to report bugs is to use the bug submission form for
MHonArc located at <http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=mhonarc>. Please
check and search the existing bugs to verify that the bug has not already
been reported.

If the bug you discovered has not been reported, select the Submit Bug link
to get the bug submission form. Hopefully, the form fields are
self-explanatory, but if you are not sure what to select in some of the
option items, leave it with the default value or make a best guess.
