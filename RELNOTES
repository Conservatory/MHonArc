Release Notes for MHonArc
=========================
<URL:http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html>

Read the CHANGES document for changes that may affect you if you are
a user of an earlier version of MHonArc.

===========================================================================
Version 2.3.3

    See notes below about v2.3.x releases if upgrading from v2.2,
    or earlier, or from an earlier v2.3 release.

Version 2.3.2

    o	A new (improved) "install.me" exists to install MHonArc.
	See INSTALL for more information.

Version 2.3.0, 2.3.1

    o	If you have archives created with v2.1.x, or earlier, you
	must update the archives before using versions v2.3, or
	later.

	To update your archives, you use the mha-dbedit program
	using the def-mime.mrc in the examples directory.  For example:

	    mha-dbedit -rcfile examples/def-mime.mrc \
		       -outdir /path/to/archive

	Make sure that the mhonarc you are using is v2.3, or later.
	Change the -rcfile and -outdir pathnames to reflect where
	you are running mhonarc and where your archive is located,
	respectively.

	Note, if your archives are using custom settings of
	MIMEFILTERS, MIMEARGS, and/or CHARSETCONVERTERS resources,
	you will need to create a variant version of def-mime.mrc
	(included in the examples directory) to include your settings
	and use the variant version when updating your archives.

===========================================================================
Version 2.2.0

    o	*IMPORTANT* *IMPORTANT* *IMPORTANT* *IMPORTANT* *IMPORTANT* 

	If you have archives created with v2.1.x, or earlier, you
	must update the archive before using v2.2.0, and later.  If
	you are creating new archives, then you can skip the how-to
	on upgrading older archives.

	To update your v2.1.x, or earlier, archives, you can run the
	-editidx option with the def-mime.rc resource in the examples
	directory on your archives.  For example:

	    mhonarc -editidx -rcfile examples/def-mime.rc \
		    -outdir /path/to/archive

	Make sure that the mhonarc you are using is v2.2.0, or later.
	Of course, change the -rcfile and -outdir pathname to reflect
	where you are running mhonarc and where your archive is
	located, respectively.

	The key is to apply the def-mime.rc to all your archives.
	Note, if your archives are using custom settings of
	MIMEFILTERS, MIMEARGS, and/or CHARSETCONVERTERS resources,
	you will need to create a variant version of def-mime.rc
	to include your settings and use the variant version when
	updating your archives.

    o	If you have written any custom MIME filters, you filters may
	be affected by v2.2.0.	If your filter accessed some
	main variables, your filter will not operate properly.
	All variables that used to be in package "main" are no
	longer.  The major variables are now in package "mhonarc".
	For example, $::OUTDIR is now $mhonarc::OUTDIR.  See the
	MIMEFILTERS resource page for more information.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.2

    o	The new default setting for CHARSETCONVERTERS will not get
	used in existing archives.  If you want the settings to
	help improve the performance on existing archives, you need
	to define the following resource:

	<CHARSETCONVERTERS>
	plain:main'htmlize:
	us-ascii:main'htmlize:
	iso-8859-1:main'htmlize:
	</CHARSETCONVERTERS>

	If you do not specify a resource file each time you update
	and archive, you can create one with the above settings and
	do -editidx so subsequent updates will use the new settings
	(you do not need to respecify the resource file again after
	the -editidx operation).

    o	For a reason why you may want to set the ARCHIVE resource to
	0, see the ARCHIVE resource page of the documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.1

    o	A bug-fix, minor enhancement, release.  There are no
	changes to MHonArc that require any special notes.

    o	A new (contributed) program, prsfrom.pl, has been added to
	the extras directory.  This program may be of use depending
	on the type of input you pass to MHonArc.  See the extras
	README for more information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1.0

    o	See the Warnings in the documentation for the new HTMLEXT
	and MSGPREFIX resources before using them.

    o	To take advantage of the new default MIMEFILTERS setting
	for existing archives, you will need set the MIMEFILERS
	resource in a update operation.  The simplest approach
	is to perform an -editidx on existing archives with a
	resource file containing the following settings:

	<MIMEFILTERS>
	model/*:m2h_external'filter:mhexternal.pl
	text/enriched:m2h_text_enriched'filter:mhtxtenrich.pl
	text/richtext:m2h_text_enriched'filter:mhtxtenrich.pl
	</MIMEFILTERS>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.1

	See the BUGS file for an important bug fix related to
	empty database entries.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0

	o  The installation process has changed slightly.  Please
	   read the installation instructions in the README
	   carefully.

	o  Documentation is now provided only in HTML.

	o  There are some changes to how data is stored in the
	   database file from v1.x.  If MHonArc v2.0 reads a 1.x
	   archive, it will automatically convert the 1.x data into
	   2.0 data.  All existing resource settings will be preserved.

	   NOTE
		Once an archive has been processed by v2.0, the
		database may no longer be utilized by v1.x.  If
		v1.x is used later to process the archive,
		unpredictable results will occur.
