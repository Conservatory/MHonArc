#   This is the Conservatory archive of the MHonArc mail-to-HTML converter.  #
#   MHonArc is written and still actively maintained by Earl Hood.  Because  #
#   his CVS repository is currently not publicly accessible, we've created   #
#   this Conservatory Git repository.  However, if you have bug reports or   #
#   other questions, please bring them to https://www.mhonarc.org/.          #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For MHonArc, we used    #
#   https://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/CHANGES as a list of all the historical  #
#   releases available, and found whatever release packages we could on the  #
#   Internet.  We have committed each upstream release package as one git    #
#   revision, starting from an early 1.0.0 zipfile from 1994.  We were not   #
#   able to find every release, however.  We would happily rebuild the git   #
#   repository to include more releases as people find them.                 # 
#                                                                            #
#   This README is the only file we've changed from upstream, and the only   #
#   change we made was to add this note.  Below is the original content of   #
#   the README file.                                                         #

INSTALLATION

    Please read RELNOTES before installing MHonArc for any news
    about compatibility with previous versions and/or important
    usage information.

    Read the file INSTALL, or load doc/install.html into your favorite
    web client, for instructions on how to install MHonArc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation for MHonArc is located in the doc/ directory.
    The main documentation for MHonArc is in multiple HTML files.
    Load index.html in the doc/ directory into your Web browser to
    get started.

    Filenames of the documentation do NOT follow the 8.3 convention.
    Therefore, you will need a filesystem that supports long names
    to read the documentation locally.

    Some tables are used in the documentation.  Therefore, having
    a table-capable viewer is beneficial, but not essential.
    Documentation is still readable in clients like Lynx.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAILING LIST

    A MHonArc mailing list exists to provide a general discussion
    forum for users and developers.  The list is the main source for
    the latest news about MHonArc.

    mhonarc-request@ncsa.uiuc.edu with the single word "subscribe"
    (without the quotes) as the message body.

    subscribers.

    The list is restricted to subscribers only.  Messages sent to the
    list by non-subscribers are manually screened before distribution;
    which may incur a significant delay before the message is actually
    seen be subscribers.  Any spam messages are happily redirected
    to /dev/null.

    the following URLs:

    If you are so inclined, feel free to send the author a donation
    if you feel guilty on using a program that that cost you nothing,
    but some poor soul sweated over.  The author is more than happy
    to provide address information to prospective donors inorder to
    ease their conscience.  Plus, requests from donors are more likely
    to get more timely responses ;-) and help insure the continued
    development of the program.
