<H1><A NAME="30719">Diagnostics</A>
</H1>

<P>Three types of messages exist in <EM>MHonArc</EM>: <EM>Informative</EM> messages, <EM>Warnings</EM>, and 
<EM>Errors</EM>. <EM>Informative</EM> messages give you the current status of <EM>MHonArc</EM>'s execution. 
<EM>Warnings</EM> signify undesired conditions, but are <EM>not</EM> critical in <EM>MHonArc</EM>'s exection. 
<EM>Errors</EM> signify critical conditions that inhibit <EM>MHonArc</EM> from finishing its task.
</P>
<P>Another set of messages exists that are generated from the Perl interpreter itself. 
<EM>MHonArc</EM> tries its best to catch any conditions that may cause Perl to abnormally 
abort, but conditions may arise where this is not possible.
</P>
<P>This section describes the various diagnostics <EM>MHonArc</EM> may produce and 
messages Perl may produce.
</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="MMM0">Informative messages
</A></H2>

<P>Informative messages may be suppressed via the <A HREF="overview.html#11196"><CODE>-quiet</CODE></A> command-line option. 
Only the more important Informative messages are listed here.
</P>
<H3>Could not process message with given Content-Type: ...
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> will output this statement <EM>in</EM> filtered mail messages for content-types it 
is unable to process. See <A HREF="mime.html#20677">Default Filters</A> in <A HREF="mime.html#23201">MIME</A> for content-types that <EM>MHonArc</EM> 
supports by default. See <A HREF="mime.html#24464">Writing Filters</A> for adding new filters into <EM>MHonArc</EM>.
</P>
<P>This is the only Informative message that does not go to standard output, but into 
the actual filtered mail message.
</P>
<H3>No new messages
</H3>

<P>No mail messages exist when performing an add operation to an archive. This can 
occur if an empty <EM>MH</EM> mail folder, or empty mailbox file, is passed to <EM>MHonArc</EM>.
</P>
<H3>Requiring MIME filter libraries ...
</H3>

<P>Indicates <EM>MHonArc</EM> is loading external libraries for filtering mail messages. 
<EM>MHonArc</EM> will output each library it loads. See <A HREF="mime.html#23201">MIME</A> for more information of filter 
libraries.
</P>
<H3>Trying to lock mail archive ...
</H3>

<P>The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive you are trying to 
update. Normally, an existing lock file implies that another <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is 
currently using the archive, and other <EM>MHonArc</EM> processes will wait awhile to see 
if the archive will be unlocked.
</P>
<P>However, there are times when a lock file exists, but no <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is 
modifying the archive. This can occur if <EM>MHonArc</EM> is abnormally terminated. If you 
know that no other <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is editting the archive you are try to modify, 
then manually remove the lock file or use the <A HREF="overview.html#31625"><CODE>-force</CODE></A> option.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF="details.html#13308">Archive Integrity</A> for more information.
</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="MMM1">Warnings
</A></H2>

<P>Warning messages denote some undesired event occurred, but the event is not 
severe enough to cause program termination.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Could not find date for message
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to find a received/sent date for a mail message. With respect 
to other mail messages, a message with no received/sent date is first in 
chronological order.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Database (&lt;dbversion&gt;) != program (&lt;prgversion&gt;) version
</H3>

<P>Indicates that the version of <EM>MHonArc</EM> updating an archive is different from the 
version of <EM>MHonArc</EM> that created the database file. Problems can arise if the 
database file changes in format from different version of <EM>MHonArc</EM>. See the release 
notes of the <EM>MHonArc</EM> distribution if changes in the databse format has effects on 
older archives.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Unable to create &lt;outdir&gt;/&lt;dbfile&gt;
</H3>

<P>Indicates <EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to create the database file <EM>&lt;dbfile&gt;</EM> for the mail 
archive created/modified in <EM>&lt;outdir&gt;</EM>. This message can occur if <EM>&lt;outdir&gt;</EM> 
permissions changed during <EM>MHonArc</EM> execution, the existing <EM>&lt;dbfile&gt;</EM> is read-only, 
or the file system is full.
</P>
<P>This message can be severe because no future add operations can be performed to 
the archive.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Unable to open footer: &lt;footer&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the footer file, <EM>&lt;footer&gt;</EM>, for inclusion into the index

<H3>Warning: Unable to open header: &lt;header&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the header file, <EM>&lt;header&gt;</EM>, for inclusion into the index 
page. Make sure <EM>&lt;header&gt;</EM> exists, and is readable by you.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Unable to open &lt;folder&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the specified mail <EM>&lt;folder&gt;</EM> for reading. Make sure

</P>
<H3>Warning: Unable to open resource file: &lt;file&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the resource file, <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM>, for reading. Make sure <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM> 
exists, and is readable by you.
</P>
<H3>Warning: Undefined time zone: "&lt;timezone&gt;"
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> has found an unrecognized timezone acronym, <EM>&lt;timezone&gt;</EM>, in a mail 
message. You can tell <EM>MHonArc</EM> about other timezone acronyms, and their hour 
offset to UTC, by using the <A HREF="rcfile.html#13741"><CODE>TIMEZONES</CODE></A> resource element of the <A HREF="rcfile.html#21846">Resource File</A>.
</P>
<P>The timezone UTC (or GMT) is used for an undefined timezone acronym
</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="MMM2">Errors
</A></H2>

<P>Errors denote conditions that cause <EM>MHonArc</EM> to abort execution.
</P>
<P>Some error conditions may cause the <EM>MHonArc</EM> archive to become corrupted. If the 
error occurs when <EM>MHonArc</EM> is writing files, you may have to recreate the archive 
from the original messages.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Database read error of &lt;dbfile&gt; 
</H3>

<P>An error occured when trying to read an archive's database. The error can occur if 
the database file is not readable or the file got corrupted.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to create &lt;file&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to create <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM>. This message can occur if the directory being 
written to is not writable, a read-only file with the same name exists, or the file 
system is full.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to create &lt;lockfile&gt; after &lt;#&gt; tries
</H3>

<P>The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive you are trying to 
update.
</P>
<P>Sometimes a lock file exists, but no <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is modifying the archive. This 
can occur if <EM>MHonArc</EM> is abnormally terminated. If you know that no other 
<EM>MHonArc</EM> process is editting the archive you are try to modify, then manually 
remove the lock file or use the <A HREF="overview.html#31625"><CODE>-force</CODE></A> option.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to open &lt;file&gt;
</H3>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM> for reading. Make sure <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM> exists, and is

</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to require newgetopt.pl
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>newgetopt.pl</CODE> library is needed for <EM>MHonArc</EM> to parse the command-line. 
<CODE>newgetopt.pl</CODE> is part of the standard Perl distribution. Make sure Perl has been 
correctly installed at your site.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to require timelocal.pl
</H3>

<P>The <CODE>timelocal.pl</CODE> library is needed for <EM>MHonArc</EM> to process dates in messages.

correctly installed at your site.
</P>
<H3>ERROR: Unable to require &lt;file&gt;
</H3>

<P>This message signifies <EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to require the library <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM>. Make sure 
you properly installed <EM>MHonArc</EM> via the installation program. If <EM>&lt;file&gt;</EM> is your own 
custom filter, make sure you properly registered it in the <A HREF="rcfile.html#21846">Resource File</A>. See also 
<A HREF="mime.html#19421">Specifying Filters</A> and the <A HREF="rcfile.html#33543"><CODE>PERLINC</CODE></A> resource element.
</P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="MMM3">Perl Messages
</A></H2>

<P>Generally, if execution is aborted and the following error messages appear, then 
you will have to manually delete the lock file since <EM>MHonArc</EM> will not have the 
chance to delete the file.
</P>
<H3>Can't locate &lt;file&gt; in @INC at &lt;file&gt; line &lt;number&gt;.
