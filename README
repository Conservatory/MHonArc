#   This is the Conservatory archive of the MHonArc mail-to-HTML converter.  #
#   MHonArc is written and still actively maintained by Earl Hood.  Because  #
#   his CVS repository is currently not publicly accessible, we've created   #
#   this Conservatory Git repository.  However, if you have bug reports or   #
#   other questions, please bring them to https://www.mhonarc.org/.          #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For MHonArc, we used    #
#   https://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/CHANGES as a list of all the historical  #
#   releases available, and found whatever release packages we could on the  #
#   Internet.  We have committed each upstream release package as one git    #
#   revision, starting from an early 1.0.0 zipfile from 1994.  We were not   #
#   able to find every release, however.  We would happily rebuild the git   #
#   repository to include more releases as people find them.                 # 
#                                                                            #
#   This README is the only file we've changed from upstream, and the only   #
#   change we made was to add this note.  Below is the original content of   #
#   the README file.                                                         #

DOCUMENTATION

    Documentation for MHonArc is located in the doc/ directory.
    The main documentation for MHonArc is in multiple HTML files.
    Load mhonarc.html in the doc/ directory into your Web browser to
    get started.

    Filenames of the documentation do NOT follow the 8.3 convention.

    a table-capable viewer is beneficial.  If your viewer does not
    recognize tables, the documentation should still be usable.
