<H1><A NAME="diagnostics">Appendix: Diagnostics</A></H1>

<P>Three types of messages exist in <EM>MHonArc</EM>:
<EM>Informative</EM> messages, <EM>Warnings</EM>, and
<EM>Errors</EM>. <EM>Informative</EM> messages give you the
current status of <EM>MHonArc</EM>'s execution.  <EM>Warnings</EM>
signify undesired conditions, but are <EM>not</EM> critical in
<EM>MHonArc</EM>'s exection.  <EM>Errors</EM> signify critical
conditions that inhibit <EM>MHonArc</EM> from finishing its task.  </P>

<P>Another set of messages exists that are generated from the Perl
interpreter itself.  <EM>MHonArc</EM> tries its best to catch any
conditions that may cause Perl to abnormally abort, but conditions
may arise where this is not possible.  </P> <P>This section describes
the various diagnostics <EM>MHonArc</EM> may produce and messages
Perl may produce.  </P>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="infomsgs">Informative messages</A></H2>

<P>Informative messages may be suppressed via the
<A HREF="resources/quiet.html">QUIET</A> resource.
Only the more important Informative messages are listed here.  </P>

<h4>No new messages</h4>

<P>No new mail messages exist when performing an add operation to an
archive. This can occur if an empty <EM>MH</EM> mail folder, or empty
mailbox file, is passed to <EM>MHonArc</EM>i; or the folder
contains messages already in the archive.
</P>

<h4>Trying to lock mail archive ...</h4>

<P>The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive
you are trying to update. Normally, an existing lock file implies
that another <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is currently using the archive,
and other <EM>MHonArc</EM> processes will wait awhile to see if the
archive will be unlocked.  </P>

<P>However, there are times when a lock file exists, but no
<EM>MHonArc</EM> process is modifying the archive. This can occur
if <EM>MHonArc</EM> is abnormally terminated. If you know that no
other <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is editting the archive you are
try to modify, then manually remove the lock file or use the
<A HREF="force.html">FORCE</A> resource.  </P>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="warnings">Warnings</A></H2>

<P>Warning messages denote some undesired event occurred, but the
event is not severe enough to cause program termination.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Could not find date for message</h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to find a date for a
mail message, or could not parse the date if the date is not
in a common format.  The message is given the current date
if no date is found.
</P>

<h4>Warning: Database (<var>dbversion</var>)
!= program (<var>prgversion</var>) version</h4>

<P>Indicates that the version of <EM>MHonArc</EM> updating an archive
is different from the version of <EM>MHonArc</EM> that created the
database file. Problems can arise if the database file changes in
format from different version of <EM>MHonArc</EM>. See the release
notes of the <EM>MHonArc</EM> distribution if changes in the databse
format will effect older archives.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to create <var>outdir/dbfile</var></h4>

<P>Indicates <EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to create the
database file <var>dbfile</var> for the mail archive
created/modified in <var>outdir</var>. This message can occur if
<var>outdir</var> permissions changed during <EM>MHonArc</EM>
execution, the existing <var>dbfile</var> is read-only, or the
file system is full.  </P>

<P>This warning can be severe because no future add operations can
be performed to the archive.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open footer: <var>footer</var></h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the footer file,
<var>footer</var>, for inclusion into the index page. Make sure
<var>footer</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open header: <var>header</var>
</h4>

<P><em>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the header file,
<var>header</var>, for inclusion into the index page. Make sure
<var>header</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open <var>folder</var></h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the specified mail
<var>folder</var> for reading. Make sure <var>folder</var>
exists and is readable (and executable if a directory) by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open message: <var>folder/message</var>
</h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the specified <EM>MH</EM>
mail message <var>folder/message</var> for reading. Make sure
<var>folder/message</var> exists and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open resource file: <var>file</var>
</h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open the resource file,
<var>file</var>, for reading. Make sure <var>file</var> exists, and
is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Undefined time zone: "<var>timezone</var>"
</h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> has found an unrecognized timezone
acronym, <var>timezone</var>, in a mail
message. You can tell <EM>MHonArc</EM> about other timezone
acronyms, and their hour offset to UTC, by using the <A
HREF="resources/timezones.html">TIMEZONES</A> resource
</P>

<P>The timezone UTC (or GMT) is used for an undefined timezone acronyms.
</P>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="errors">Errors</A></H2>

<P>Errors denote conditions that cause <EM>MHonArc</EM> to abort
execution.  </P>

<P>Some error conditions may cause the <EM>MHonArc</EM> archive to
become corrupted. If the error occurs when <EM>MHonArc</EM> is writing
files, you may have to recreate the archive from the original messages.
</P>

<h4>ERROR: Database read error of <var>dbfile</var></h4>

<P>An error occured when trying to read an archive's database. The
error can occur if the database file is not readable or the file
got corrupted.  </P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to create <var>file</var></h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to create <var>file</var>. This
message can occur if the directory being written to is not writable, a
read-only file with the same name exists, or the file system is full.
</P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to create lockfile after <var>#</var> tries
</h4>

<P>The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive
you are trying to update.  </P>

<P>Sometimes a lock file exists, but no <EM>MHonArc</EM>
process is modifying the archive. This can occur if
<EM>MHonArc</EM> is abnormally terminated. If you know that no
other <EM>MHonArc</EM> process is editting the archive you are
try to modify, then manually remove the lock file or use the <A
HREF="resources/force.html">FORCE</A> resource.  </P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to open <var>file</var></h4>

<P><EM>MHonArc</EM> was unable to open <var>file</var> for reading. Make
sure <var>file</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to require <var>perl-library</var></h4>

<p>Make sure you properly installed <EM>MHonArc</EM>.  Also
make sure Perl is installed properly if the library is a standard
Perl library.
</p>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="perlmsgs">Perl Messages</A></H2>

<P>Generally, if execution is aborted and the following error messages
appear, then you will have to manually delete the lock file since
<EM>MHonArc</EM> will not have the chance to delete the file.  </P>

<h4>Can't locate file in @INC at <var>file</var> line number.
</h4>

<P>A library that <EM>MHonArc</EM> tried to load was not found
in the Perl include search paths. This error usually implies
that <EM>MHonArc</EM> was not installed correctly. Make sure that
<EM>MHonArc</EM> was installed via the <CODE>install.me</CODE> program
that is provided in the <EM>MHonArc</EM> distribution.  </P>

<h4><var>file</var> did not return a true value at file line number.</h4>

<P>If you are using your own MIME filters with <EM>MHonArc</EM>, make
sure the library files return 1.  </P>
