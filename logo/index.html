<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document provides the usage policy and creation history
of the MHonArc butterfly and related images.  </p>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Since the various butterfly images are original creations,
applicable copyrights apply.  Use of these images are restricted
within in the context of MHonArc.  For example, it is okay to use
the images when making a reference to MHonArc, but it is <b>not</b>
okay to use these images in other contexts unrelated to MHonArc.  </p>

    <td><p><b>The Butterfly</b></p>

    <p>The first incarnation of the MHonArc logo was created back in
    September of 1994 for the first release of MHonArc, the compatible
    successor to the more utilitarian named <tt>mail2html</tt>.
    The name <tt>mail2html</tt> was non-unique, so I knew I had to
    come up with a unique name and a logo to have the program standout
    among the others like the comparable program Hypermail did (who
    says that free software does not need a little marketing).  </p>

    <p>My mother had an old animal encyclopedia set,
    so we went through it in the hope to get some ideas.
    But nothing clicked.  So I played with related terms like "<a
    href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mh/"><tt>MH</tt></a>" (an MUA that
    I used and the main reason MHonArc exists because there was
    no program that supported MH mail folders), "<tt>mail</tt>",
    "<tt>archive</tt>", and "<tt>HTML</tt>" and thought, "What
    animals have names that have letters/syllables in common with
    those terms?"  Then it clicked, "Monarch."  I decided to move the
    '<tt>h</tt>' to follow the '<tt>M</tt>' and use a mixed-case
    name to make the spelling unique and to imply some meaning.
    The capitalized letters stand for "<b>M</b>ail", "<b>H</b>TML",
    and "<b>A</b>rchive."  An alternative meaning for "<b>MH</b>"
    is to represent the venerable MH mail program.  </p>

    <p>My mother did a line sketch of half of the butterfly based
    on a photo within the encyclopedia set.  With an Atari MegaST, I
    scanned the sketch with a hand scanner.  The image was then colored
    using Degas Elite and mirrored to make the complete butterfly.
    Some artistic license was used in the color choices since monarch
    butterflies typically do not have the kind of variations shown
    here within the main red/orange/yellow part of the wings. </p>

    <p>All the pseudo anti-aliasing effects to smooth out the lines
    and edges were all done by hand, pixel-by-pixel.  </p>

    <p>Since the MegaST color-mode only supported 16 colors, the image
    only has 12 unique colors, even though it appears to have more.
    </p>

    <p>All other MHonArc images are derived from this image.</p>

    <td><p><b>MHonArc Stamp</b> (version 1)</p>

    <p>The stamp border and lettering was done with XPaint in September
    of 1994.  I could not use my Atari MegaST since the maximum
    color resolution was 320x200, which the base butterfly image
    mostly filled.  The transparent background version was done by
    using ImageMagick.  Most of the main images have a non-transparent
    and transparent background version, and for brevity, I only display
    one or the other since the background is all that differs.</p>

    <p>The number "<tt>1521</tt>" represent the main RFC that documented
    the MIME standard at the time the image was created
    (which has now been superceded by RFCs 2045-2049).
    </p>

    <p>The Version 1 stamp was used in the table-of-contents of the <a
    href="../doc/mhonarc.html">Reference Manual</a>, but was eventually
    replaced by the <a href="#stamp2">Version 2 stamp</a> in 1998. </p>

    <td><p><b>MHonArc Stamp</b> (version 2)</p>

    <p>In July of 1998, I had access to a system with Adobe Photoshop
    (version 4 I believe).  So I played with it.  The results is the
    second version of the stamp logo using some of the visual effects
    capabilities in Photoshop. </p>

    <p>If you are wondering, "Why didn't you use Gimp?"  at the time, I was
    not very familiar with Gimp, and I believe Gimp was in its pre-1.0
    stage.  I now use Gimp for all my fancy image editing needs.  </p>

    <p>This version of the stamp logo serves as the main logo for
    the <a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">homepage</a>  and the <a
    href="../doc/mhonarc.html">Reference Manual</a>, and has done so
    for several years.  <a href="#stamp1">Version 1</a> of the stamp
    is no longer used and only exists for historical reasons.  </p>

    <td><p><b>FAQ Logo</b></p>

    <p>This version was generated by scaling down the <a
    href="#butterfly">butterfly</a> with ImageMagick and then making
    the background transparent.  The anti-aliasing effects of the
    scaling provided a nice side-effect of creating a blue halo
    around the image.  The halo helps make the logo useful on any
    colored background (especially black).  </p>

    <p>This image was also created using Photoshop in '98 by using
    the the text "<tt>MHonArc</tt>" as a stencil cut-out of the <a

    the <a href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">homepage</a>.  </p>

    <td><p><b>Butterfly Background Tile</b></p>

    <p>This image was also created using Photoshop in '98 by having a
    layer for the butterfly and a layer for the bumpy background with
    the butterfly being mostly transparent.  It took me a long time
    to finally come up with a graphical background tile I liked.  All
    the other variations and styles I tried are not shown here.
    </p>

    <p>Note, this background tile is actually a 75%
    reduction of the original tile which was the same size as the <a
    href="#butterfly">butterfly</a> image.  This was done to avoid
    any alignment problems when the regular-sized butterfly appeared
    above this background.</p>

    <p>The background tile is used for the <a
    href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">homepage</a>
    , and the table-of-contents page of the <a
    href="../doc/mhonarc.html">Reference Manual</a>.  </p>

    <p>This version was generated by scaling down <a

    the touch of blue.</p>

    <p>This icon is used throughout the
    <a href="../doc/">documentation</a> and the <a
    href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">homepage</a>.  </p>

    <td><p><b>Navigation Icons</b></p>

    <p>These images are the navigational buttons used in the <a
    href="../doc/mhonarc.html">Reference Manual</a>.  If I remember
    correctly. these are also done using Photoshop in 1998 when the
    <a href="#stamp2">Version 2 stamp</a> was done. </p>

    <p>Initially, large versions of the icons were created to make it
    easy to edit and work with.  Once done, I used ImageMagick to scale
    down the images to what you see here. </p>

    <p>The only thing borrowed when creating the icons was the little
    house for the <i>home</i> icon.  The house was taken from Netscape.
    I have not gotten in trouble, yet, for doing this.  The
    <i>home</i> icon is also the only navigational icon where the
    butterfly appears behind the symbolic graphic.</p>

    <p>The "Powered By" logo was contributed by Ian Richardson in the
    Novermber of 2000.  I do not know what software was used, but
    the <a href="#icon">Icon</a> and <a href="#title">Graphic Title</a>
    were used in its composition.
