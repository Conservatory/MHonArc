ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS for MHonArc

    http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html

I would like to thank everyone who has given feedback on MHonArc.
Sorry for not listing everyone, but it has become too hard to keep
track of all the names.  However, I'd like to give special thanks to
the following:

 A. P. Barrett <barrett@ee.und.ac.za>
	For developing a base64 library.  The library has been adapted
	to decode base64 messages by MHonArc.

 Susie Blackstock <seads@convex.hp.com>
	For helping me with the documentation.  Any problems with the
	documentation is purely my fault.  And she's cute too.

 Achim Bohnet <ach@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
	For his help in testing, and contributing to, mhonarc and for
	setting up, and maintaining, the mhonarc mailing list.

 Roman Czyborra <czyborra@cs.tu-berlin.de>
	For his help with the MosaicMail script.

 Timothy Finin <Tim.Finin@cs.umbc.edu>
	Whose initial feedback on mbox2html (my first mail->HTML
	program) caused the ball rolling on developing a more complete
	mail-to-HTML program.

 Stephen Franlin <franklin@uci.edu>
	For providing the machine facilities for housing the MHonArc
	home page.

 Ken Harward <harward@convex.com>
	For helping me tackle Perl problems and for bouncing ideas
	off.

 Phyllis Imperatrice <mymom@home>
	For the initial sketch of the MHonArc logo.

 Steve Pacenka <sp17@cornell.edu>
	For his great help in getting MHonArc to run under MS-DOS, and
	for his help in trouble-shooting.

 Achille Petrilli <Achille.Petrilli@MACMAIL.CERN.CH>
	For his initial patches for MacPerl support to get the
	ball rolling for MacPerl usage.

 NIIBE Yutaka <gniibe@mri.co.jp>
	For the contribution of a text/plain filter to process
	ISO-2022 encoded mail messages (ie. Japanese character set).
