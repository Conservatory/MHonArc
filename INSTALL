SUMMARY

This document gives the basic method for installing MHonArc on your
system.  Please read this entire document before installation.

    NOTE  Please read RELNOTES before installing MHonArc for any
	  news about compatibility with previous versions and/or
	  important usage information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

    o	Perl 5 is installed.  If you do not have Perl 5, goto
	<URL:http://www.perl.com/> for download information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLING FILES

Provided in the MHonArc distribution is a Perl program, "install.me"
that will install MHonArc on your system.  To run the program, type
the following at your shell prompt:

    shell-prompt> perl install.me

Note, you must be in the same directory as the install.me program
when you run it.

The installation program will ask you a series of questions on where
the perl executable is and where to put MHonArc files.  Just hit
<CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.  Note, the default
values are determined by the configuration of perl on your system.
If you choose the defaults, you may need to have root/admin privileges
to have a successful install.

install.me can take several options on the command-line to affect
what is done during installation.  The following is the list of options
available:

  -batch                : Run in batch mode (do not ask questions)
  -binpath <path>       : Directory path to install programs/scripts
  -docpath <path>       : Directory path to install documentation
  -help                 : A message summarizing options available
  -libpath <path>       : Directory path to install library files
  -filelist <file>      : List of files to install (def="FILELIST")
  -manpath <path>       : Directory path to manpages
  -nobin                : Do not install programs
  -nodoc                : Do not install documentation
  -nolib                : Do not install library files
  -noman                : Do not install manpages
  -perl <pathname>      : Pathname of perl interpreter
  -prefix <path>        : Set prefix for installation directories

For example, if you do not want to install the documentation, do
the following:

    shell-prompt> perl install.me -nodoc

Later on, if you decide you want to install the documentation, but
not re-install the other files, do the following:

    shell-prompt> perl install.me -nobin -nolib -noman

If you want to install files relative to your home directory, do the
following:

    shell-prompt> perl install.me -prefix $HOME

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
install.me NOTES

    o	The "#!" line in the installed programs are set to point to
	the perl executable specified in the installation process.
	This is convienence for those using systems that support the
	"#!" notation.

    o	The installation lib directory is added to each program's
	search path so each program can find the libaries needed for
	proper execution.  Therefore, you should NOT have to set your
	PERL5LIB environment variable if you install the library files
	in a location not in the default perl library search path.

    o	If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
	program will create the paths for you.	If running in
	interactive mode, you will be prompted before each path
	is created.

    o	install.me supports environment variable interpolation in
	pathnames specified during interactive installation.
	For example, if you want to install the program files into
	your local bin directory, you can enter the following when
	prompted for the location to install executables:

	    $HOME/bin

	Also, if the '~' character is the first character of the
	pathname specified, it will be expanded to the value of the
	HOME environment variable.  Therefore, the following are
	equivalent:

	    $HOME/bin
	    ~/bin

    o	If you want to abort the installation, just enter the
	termination character.	For Unix systems, it is normally
	Ctrl-C; for Win32 systems, it is normally Ctrl-Z.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WIN32 NOTES

    o	The main programs will automatically be converted to DOS batch
	files.  Hence, if the path location of the main programs is
	in your PATH, you should be able to invoke them like any other
	program.  Note, the path to the perl executable must be in
	your PATH, also.

    o	In the logo/ directory of the distribution is a BMP file
	"mhaicon.bmp".  You can copy the image into your Windows Icon
	directory.  Then through the file types editor of the file
	explorer, you can specify mhaicon.bmp as the icon for MHonArc
	resource (.mrc) files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERNATE OPERATING SYSTEMS

In many cases, the install.me program will work for other operating
systems.  Please contact the author on any success stories for
other operating systems, and please send any patches, if required.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANUAL INSTALLATION

If install.me will not work properly for your system, here are the
steps to install MHonArc manually:

    o   Copy library (*.pl) files in the "lib" directory to the
        library location you desire.

    o   Copy the program files to the location you want them
        installed.  After copying, you must edit the each file
        as follows:

            -   Edit the "#!/..." line (the first line of each file)
		to be the complete pathname of your perl interpreter.
		Note, this step is only required for systems (Unix)
		that support "#!".

            -   Add a new line right after the "#!/..." line to
                contain the following:

                    use lib "/path/to/lib/files";

                where "/path/to/lib/files/" is the path to where
                copied the library files to.

                Note, if the location you copied the libraries are
                already part of Perl's standard library search path,
                you do not need to add the "use lib" statement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESOURCE FILE EDITING

If you are a Vim user, <URL:http://www.vim.org/>, a syntax file
for MHonArc resource files is included in the examples directory
(mhonarc.vim).  Vim is known to run on a variety of operating systems,
and is free software.

To use mhonarc.vim, copy mhonarc.vim to an appropriate location and
add something like the following to your .vimrc file:

au BufNewFile,BufRead *.mrc	so $HOME/share/vim/syntax/mhonarc.vim

Of course, change the pathname to mhonarc.vim to wherever you copied
it to.

Now, any file with ".mrc" extension will put Vim into MHonArc resource
file highlighting mode.  The mode is best used with color-capable
terminals.
