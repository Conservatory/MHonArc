<H1><A NAME="diagnostics">Appendix: Diagnostics</A></H1>

<P>Three types of messages exist in MHonArc:
<EM>Informative</EM> messages, <EM>Warnings</EM>, and
<EM>Errors</EM>. <EM>Informative</EM> messages give you the
current status of MHonArc's execution.  <EM>Warnings</EM>
signify undesired conditions, but are <EM>not</EM> critical in
MHonArc's exection.  <EM>Errors</EM> signify critical
conditions that inhibit MHonArc from finishing its task.  </P>

<P>Another set of messages exists that are generated from the Perl
interpreter itself.  MHonArc tries its best to catch any
conditions that may cause Perl to abnormally abort, but conditions
may arise where this is not possible.  </P> <P>This section describes
the various diagnostics MHonArc may produce and messages
Perl may produce.  </P>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="infomsgs">Informative messages</A></H2>

<P>Informative messages may be suppressed via the
<A HREF="resources/quiet.html">QUIET</A> resource.
Only the more important Informative messages are listed here.  </P>

<h4>No new messages</h4>

<P>No new mail messages exist when performing an add operation to an
archive. This can occur if an empty <EM>MH</EM> mail folder, or empty
mailbox file, is passed to MHonArc; or the folder
contains messages already in the archive.
</P>

<h4>Trying to lock mail archive ...</h4>

<P>The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive
you are trying to update.  Normally, an existing lock file implies
that another MHonArc process is currently using the archive,
and other MHonArc processes will wait awhile to see if the
archive will be unlocked.
The time MHonArc waits can be modified
by the <a href="resources/locktries.html">LOCKTRIES</a> and
<a href="resources/lockdelay.html">LOCKDELAY</a> resources.
</P>

<P>There are times when a lock file exists, but no
MHonArc process is modifying the archive. This can occur
if MHonArc is abnormally terminated.  If you know that no
other MHonArc process is editing the archive you are
try to modify, then manually remove the lock file or use the
<A HREF="force.html">FORCE</A> resource.
</P>

<td width="100%"><p>If <a href="resources/lockmethod.html">LOCKMETHOD</a>
is set to <tt>flock</tt>, then the lock file should never be
manually deleted.  When MHonArc abnormally terminates, then the
lock will be automatically released when the <tt>flock</tt> method
is used.  A stale lock can still occur under the <tt>flock</tt>
method if for some reason a MHonArc
process hangs.  In this case, just kill the offending process and
the lock will automatically be released.

<H2><A NAME="warnings">Warnings</A></H2>

<P>Warning messages denote some undesired event occurred, but the
event is not severe enough to cause program termination.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Could not find date for message</h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to find a date for a
mail message, or could not parse the date if the date is not
in a common format.  The message is given the current date
if no date is found.
</P>

<h4>Warning: Database (<var>dbversion</var>)
!= program (<var>prgversion</var>) version</h4>

<P>Indicates that the version of MHonArc updating an archive
is different from the version of MHonArc that created the
database file. Problems can arise if the database file changes in
format from different version of MHonArc. See the release
notes of the MHonArc distribution if changes in the databse
format will effect older archives.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to create <var>outdir/dbfile</var></h4>

<P>Indicates MHonArc was unable to create the
database file <var>dbfile</var> for the mail archive
created/modified in <var>outdir</var>. This message can occur if
<var>outdir</var> permissions changed during MHonArc
execution, the existing <var>dbfile</var> is read-only, or the
file system is full.  </P>

<P>This warning can be severe because no future add operations can
be performed to the archive.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open footer: <var>footer</var></h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open the footer file,
<var>footer</var>, for inclusion into the index page. Make sure
<var>footer</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open header: <var>header</var>
</h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open the header file,
<var>header</var>, for inclusion into the index page. Make sure
<var>header</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open <var>folder</var></h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open the specified mail
<var>folder</var> for reading. Make sure <var>folder</var>
exists and is readable (and executable if a directory) by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open message: <var>folder/message</var>
</h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open the specified <EM>MH</EM>
mail message <var>folder/message</var> for reading. Make sure
<var>folder/message</var> exists and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Unable to open resource file: <var>file</var>
</h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open the resource file,
<var>file</var>, for reading. Make sure <var>file</var> exists, and
is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>Warning: Undefined time zone: "<var>timezone</var>"
</h4>

<P>MHonArc has found an unrecognized timezone
acronym, <var>timezone</var>, in a mail
message. You can tell MHonArc about other timezone
acronyms, and their hour offset to UTC, by using the <A
HREF="resources/timezones.html">TIMEZONES</A> resource
</P>

<P>The timezone UTC (or GMT) is used for an undefined timezone acronyms.
</P>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="errors">Errors</A></H2>

<P>Errors denote conditions that cause MHonArc to abort
execution.  </P>

<P>Some error conditions may cause the MHonArc archive to
become corrupted. If the error occurs when MHonArc is writing
files, you may have to recreate the archive from the original messages.
</P>

<h4>ERROR: Database read error of <var>dbfile</var></h4>

<P>An error occured when trying to read an archive's database. The
error can occur if the database file is not readable or the file
got corrupted.  </P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to create <var>file</var></h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to create <var>file</var>. This
message can occur if the directory being written to is not writable, a
read-only file with the same name exists, or the file system is full.
</P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to create lockfile after <var>#</var> tries
</h4>

<P>The statement means that MHonArc timed-out trying to obtain a
lock on the archive.  You may be able to avoid time-out problems
by modifying the <a href="resources/locktries.html">LOCKTRIES</a> and
<a href="resources/lockdelay.html">LOCKDELAY</a> resources.
</P>

<P>Sometimes a lock file exists, but no MHonArc
process is modifying the archive. This can occur if
MHonArc is abnormally terminated.  If you know that no
other MHonArc process is editting the archive you are
try to modify, then manually remove the lock file or use the
<a href="resources/force.html">FORCE</a> resource.
</P>

<table class="caution" width="100%">
<tr valign=top>
<td><strong style="color: red">WARNING</strong></td>
<td width="100%"><p>If <a href="resources/lockmethod.html">LOCKMETHOD</a>
is set to <tt>flock</tt>, then the lock file should never be
manually deleted.  When MHonArc abnormally terminates, then the
lock will be automatically released when the <tt>flock</tt> method
is used.  A stale lock can still occur under the <tt>flock</tt>
method if for some reason a MHonArc
process hangs.  In this case, just kill the offending process and
the lock will automatically be released.

<h4>ERROR: Unable to open <var>file</var></h4>

<P>MHonArc was unable to open <var>file</var> for reading. Make
sure <var>file</var> exists, and is readable by you.  </P>

<h4>ERROR: Unable to require <var>perl-library</var></h4>

<p>Make sure you properly installed MHonArc.  Also
make sure Perl is installed properly if the library is a standard
Perl library.
</p>

<hr>
<H2><A NAME="perlmsgs">Perl Messages</A></H2>

<P>Generally, if execution is aborted and the following error messages
appear, then you will have to manually delete the lock file since
MHonArc will not have the chance to delete the file.  </P>

<h4>Can't locate file in <!--
-->&#64;<!--
-->INC at <var>file</var> line number.
</h4>

<P>A library that MHonArc tried to load was not found
in the Perl include search paths. This error usually implies
that MHonArc was not installed correctly. Make sure that
MHonArc was installed via the <CODE>install.me</CODE> program
that is provided in the MHonArc distribution.  </P>

<h4><var>file</var> did not return a true value at file line number.</h4>

<P>If you are using your own MIME filters with MHonArc, make
sure the library files return a true value, like <tt>1</tt>.  </P>
