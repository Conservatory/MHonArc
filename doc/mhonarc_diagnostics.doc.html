       Three types of messages exist in <EM>MHonarc</EM>: <EM>Informative</EM> messages, <EM>Warnings</EM>, and 
       <EM>Errors</EM>. <EM>Informative</EM> messages give you the current status of <EM>MHonarc</EM>'s execution. 
       <EM>Warnings</EM> signify undesired conditions, but are <EM>not</EM> critical in <EM>MHonarc</EM>'s exection. 
       <EM>Errors</EM> signify critical conditions that inhibit <EM>MHonarc</EM> from finishing its task.
<P>

       This section describes the various diagnostics <EM>MHonarc</EM> may produce.

<H2><A NAME="xtocid1586933">Informative messages
</A></H2>

       Informative messages may be suppressed via the <A HREF="mhonarc_clopts.doc.html#11196"><CODE>-quiet</CODE></A> command-line option. 
       Only the more important Informative messages are listed here.
<P>

<H3>Could not process message with given Content-Type: ...
</H3>

       <EM>MHonarc</EM> will output this statement <EM>in</EM> filtered mail messages for content-types it is 
       unable to process. See <A HREF="mhonarc_mime.doc.html#20677">Default Filters</A> in <A HREF="mhonarc_mime.doc.html#23201">MIME</A> for content-types that <EM>MHonarc</EM> 
       supports by default. See <A HREF="mhonarc_mime.doc.html#24464">Writing Filters</A> for adding new filters into <EM>MHonarc</EM>.
<P>

       This is the only Informative message that does not go to standard output, but into 
       the actual filtered mail message.
<P>

       
<P>

<H3>No new messages
</H3>

       No mail messages exist when performing an add operation to an archive. This can 
       occur if an empty MH mail folder, or empty mailbox file, is passed to <EM>MHonarc</EM>.
<P>

       
<P>

<H3>Requiring MIME filter libraries ...
</H3>

       Indicates <EM>MHonarc</EM> is loading external libraries for filtering mail messages. 
       <EM>MHonarc</EM> will output each library it loads. See <A HREF="mhonarc_mime.doc.html#23201">MIME</A> for more information of filter 
       libraries.
<P>

       
<P>

<H3>Trying to lock mail archive ...
</H3>

       The statement means that a lock file is in place for the archive you are trying to 
       update. Normally, an existing lock file implies that another <EM>MHonarc</EM> process is 
       currently using the archive, and other <EM>MHonarc</EM> processes will wait awhile to see if 
       the archive will be unlocked.
<P>

       However, there are times when a lock file exists, but no <EM>MHonarc</EM> process is 
       modifying the archive. This can occur if <EM>MHonarc</EM> is abnormally terminated. If you 
       know that no other <EM>MHonarc</EM> process is editting the archive you are try to modify, 
       then manually remove the lock file and rerun <EM>MHonarc</EM>.
<P>

       See <A HREF="mhonarc_integrity.doc.html#36758">Archive Integrity</A> for more information.
