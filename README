#   This is the Conservatory archive of the MHonArc mail-to-HTML converter.  #
#   MHonArc is written and still actively maintained by Earl Hood.  Because  #
#   his CVS repository is currently not publicly accessible, we've created   #
#   this Conservatory Git repository.  However, if you have bug reports or   #
#   other questions, please bring them to https://www.mhonarc.org/.          #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For MHonArc, we used    #
#   https://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/CHANGES as a list of all the historical  #
#   releases available, and found whatever release packages we could on the  #
#   Internet.  We have committed each upstream release package as one git    #
#   revision, starting from an early 1.0.0 zipfile from 1994.  We were not   #
#   able to find every release, however.  We would happily rebuild the git   #
#   repository to include more releases as people find them.                 # 
#                                                                            #
#   This README is the only file we've changed from upstream, and the only   #
#   change we made was to add this note.  Below is the original content of   #
#   the README file.                                                         #

DOCUMENTATION

Documentation for MHonArc is located in the doc/ directory.

html:
    The main documentation for MHonArc is in multiple HTML files.  Load
    mhonarc.html in the doc/ directory into your Web browser to get
    started.  The HTML is generated from the Frame source via
    MifMucker,
    <URL:http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mifmucker.doc.html>.

postscript:
    The postscript file, mhonarc.ps, is available if a hardcopy version
    of the documentation is required.  Since the cross-references used
    are designed for HTML reading (ie they get converted into
    hyperlinks), they may not be as useful for hardcopy reading.
    The postscript is generated from the Frame source.

ascii:
    A plain text version of the documentation is in the single file
    mhonarc.txt.  This file is created by converting the HTML files
    into ascii.  See the Makefile in doc/ for how the conversion is
    done.

manpage:
    For Unix users, there is a manpage in doc/ called mhonarc.1.  It
    is not very fancy.  It is automatically generated like the
    ascii version.  The manpage does not follow the standard manpage
    style and is not intended to be printed via troff.

The installation process does not deal with the manpage or postscript
file.  If you want to install them, you must do it manually.  The
installation process does allow you to install the HTML and ASCII
documentation in a location of your choice.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION

This section gives the basic method for installing MHonArc on a Unix or
MS-DOS/Windows system.  The documentation (doc/install.html) contains
an installation section with more detailed information.  You can also
read the detailed instructions at
<URL:http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/MHonArc/doc/install.html>

Brief Instructions

    Interactive Installing:

	Run the following command:

	    perl install.me

	The installation program will ask you a series of questions on
	where the Perl executable is and where to put MHonArc files.
	Just hit <CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

    Batch Install:

	1. Edit the file 'install.cfg'.
	2. Run the following command:

	    perl install.me install.cfg

	The installation program will output information on what
	is being installed and where it is being installed.

Notes on Installation Program

    o The '#!' line in the installed mhonarc program is set to
      point to the Perl executable specified in the installation
      process (this has no meaning under MS-DOS).

    o The installed mhonarc program has code added so it will find
      its default libraries specified in the installation program.
      I.e.  The install lib directory is added to mhonarc's search
      path so it will find its libraries.

    o If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
      program will create the path ONLY if running in interactive
      more.  If using a configuration file (eg: install.cfg) you
      must check that all paths specified exist.

Bugs in Installation Program

    o In interactive mode, if you change a path after confirmation,
      the old specified path will still exist, even if install.me
      created it for you.  Hence, the author recommends batch install.
