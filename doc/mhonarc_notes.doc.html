<LI>          <A NAME="21846"></A>Here is the explicit order of decreasing precedence when setting 
              resources/options:
<P><UL>
<LI>                 command-line options (<EM>highest precedence</EM>)
<LI>                 resource file
<LI>                 database file
<LI>                 environment variables (<EM>lowest precedence</EM>)
<P></UL>
<LI>          Mail thread detection is dependent upon the mail messages containing the 
              message id(s) of referenced messages. Most mailers <EM>reply function</EM> will 
              automatically include the message id of the message being replied to.
<P><LI>          All mail message being converted into HTML are stored in memory before 
              they are written to disk. This can eat up much memory if many mail 
              messages are being converted. If you are processing multiple 
              mailboxes/folders and worried about memory, you can call <EM>MHonArc</EM> on 
              each one separately using the <CODE>-add</CODE> option.
<P><LI>          The database file, and the index page, are completely rewritten evertime 
              new messages are added. This may cause slight slow-downs when 
              archives become very large.
<P><LI>          In MH mode (the default), mail messages are assumed to have numeric 
              filenames in the mail folder.
<P><LI>          When sorting by date, <EM>MHonArc</EM> tries to use the date listed in the first 
              <EM>Received</EM> field of the message. If no <EM>Received</EM> field exists, than the <EM>Date</EM> field 
              is used.
<P><LI>          No distinction is made, in the output, on which messages came from 
              which mail folder/box if multiple mail folders/boxes are processed.
<P><LI>          <EM>MHonArc</EM> requires the use of <CODE>timelocal.pl</CODE>  and <CODE>newgetopt.pl</CODE>. These 
              libraries are part of the normal Perl distribution.
<P><LI>          <EM>MHonArc</EM> can probably be modified to handle other types of mailers 
              (which has been done since the original version only supported MH mail 
              folders). The <A HREF="mhonarc_rcfile.doc.html#23573"><CODE>MSGSEP</CODE></A> resource gives flexibility in processing mailbox style 
              files.
