#   This is the Conservatory archive of the MHonArc mail-to-HTML converter.  #
#   MHonArc is written and still actively maintained by Earl Hood.  Because  #
#   his CVS repository is currently not publicly accessible, we've created   #
#   this Conservatory Git repository.  However, if you have bug reports or   #
#   other questions, please bring them to https://www.mhonarc.org/.          #
#                                                                            #
#   The Conservatory (https://conservatory.github.io/) is a place where      #
#   free software that has no other public version-controlled home on the    #
#   Internet is made available in a git repository.  For MHonArc, we used    #
#   https://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/CHANGES as a list of all the historical  #
#   releases available, and found whatever release packages we could on the  #
#   Internet.  We have committed each upstream release package as one git    #
#   revision, starting from an early 1.0.0 zipfile from 1994.  We were not   #
#   able to find every release, however.  We would happily rebuild the git   #
#   repository to include more releases as people find them.                 # 
#                                                                            #
#   This README is the only file we've changed from upstream, and the only   #
#   change we made was to add this note.  Below is the original content of   #
#   the README file.                                                         #

INSTALLATION

To install MHonArc, run the following command:

	% perl install.me

The installation process will ask you a series of questions on where
the Perl executable is and where to put MHonArc files.  Just hit <CR>
to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

Notes on installation process:

    o The '#!' line in the installed mhonarc program is set to point to
      the Perl executable specified in the installation process.

    o The installed mhonarc program has code added so it will find its
      default libraries specified in the installation program.  I.e.
      The install lib directory is added to mhonarc's search path so it
      will find its libraries.

    o If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me program
      will create the path.


** PLEASE read the RELEASE_NOTES before running MHonArc.
