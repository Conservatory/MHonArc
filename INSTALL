INSTALL for MHonArc

    http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NOTE
        Installation has changed slightly from 1.x releases.  Please
        read the following instructions if you are familiar with
        the 1.x installation process.

This document gives the basic method for installing MHonArc on a Unix or
MS-DOS/Windows system.

Instructions

    Interactive Installing:

        Run the following command:

            perl install.me

        The installation program will ask you a series of questions on
        where the Perl executable is and where to put MHonArc files.
        Just hit <CR> to accept the default values listed in ()'s.

    Batch Install:

        1. Edit the file 'install.cfg'.  Knowledge of Perl is helpful.
        2. Run the following command:

            perl install.me batch

        The installation program will output information on what
        is being installed and where it is being installed.

Notes on Installation Program

    o The '#!' line in the installed mhonarc program is set to
      point to the Perl executable specified in the installation
      process (this has no meaning under MS-DOS).

    o The installed mhonarc program has code added so it will find
      its default libraries specified in the installation program.
      I.e.  The install lib directory is added to mhonarc's search
      path so it will find its libraries.

    o If you specify paths that do not exist, the install.me
      program will create the path ONLY if running in interactive
      mode.  If running in batch mode, you must check that all paths
      specified exist.

    o MSDOS/Windows users: You many need to create a batch file
      for easy invocation of MHonArc.  An example batch file
      exists in the bat/ directory of the distribution.
