=======================================================================
06/10/2001	(2.4.9)

    o	Added the following resources:

	    MIMEEXCS		List of content-types to exclude
				from processing.  Exclusion occurs
				before data is passed to filters.

    o	mhtxtplain.pl: If decoding uuencoded data, the data will
	be excluded if application/octet-stream is listed the
	MIMEEXCS resource.

    o	mhtxthtml.pl: If a CID URL is not available, the CID URL
	is no longer preserved in the converted output.  The CID
	URL is stripped.

    o	Added the following to mhmimetypes.pl content-type table:

	  application/ms-excel		=> xls:MS-Excel spreadsheet
	  application/ms-powerpoint	=> ppt:MS-Powerpoint presentation
	  application/ms-project	=> mpp:MS-Project file

	The "vnd." official versions are already present, but
	some application use the above.

    o	TODO list added to distribution.

    Bug Fixes

    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
04/13/2001	(2.4.8)

    o	Added the following resources:

	    KEEPONRMM   	Do not remove message files from disk
				when messages are removed from the
				archive.

    o	m2h_text_plain::filter now uses CHARSETCONVERTERS for
	translating text data with a specified charset parameter.
	The only exception is iso-2022-jp, which is handled directly
	to properly support nourl flag.

    o	m2h_external::filter new arguments:

	excludeexts=ext1,...
		  A comma separated list of message specified filename
		  extensions to exclude.  I.e.	If the filename
		  extension matches an extension in excludeexts, the
		  content will not be written.	The return markup
		  will contain the name of the attachment, but no
		  link to the data.  This option is best used with
		  application/octet-stream to exclude unwanted data
		  that is not tagged with the proper content-type.
		  The m2h_null::filter can be used to exclude content
		  by content-type.

    o	m2h_null::filter will now output a one line description
	of the excluded content.  This is so the reader knows that
	there was message content not saved within the archive.

    o	m2h_text_plain::filter new arguments:

	usename		If extracting uuencoded data, the filename
			specified should be used.

    o	m2h_text_html::filter new arguments:

 	allowcomments	Preserve any comment declarations.  Normally
 			Comment declarations are munged to prevent
 			SSI attacks or comments that can conflict
 			with MHonArc processing.  Use this option
 			with care.

	(NOTE: Comment declarations were completely stripped before,
	 but the regex used was known to crash perl on large comment
	 declarations, so a simplier expression is now used to
	 modify comment declarations to prevent possible attacks.)


    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
10/28/2000	(2.4.7)

    o	Added the following options to m2h_text_plain::filter:

	attachcheck	Honor attachment disposition.  By default,
			all text/plain data is displayed inline on
			the message page.  If attachcheck is specified
			and Content-Disposition specifies the data as
			an attachment, the data is saved to a file
			with a link to it from the message page.
	htmlcheck	Check if message is actually an HTML message
			(to get around abhorrent MUAs).  The message
			is treated as HTML if the first non-whitespace
			data looks like the start of an HTML document.

    o	FROMFIELD resource default value is now:

	  from:mail-reply-to:reply-to:return-path:apparently-from:
	  sender:resent-sender

	The change is the addition of "mail-reply-to."

    o	Added the following resource variables:

	    $MSGTORDNUM$	Ordinal number of message in current
				thread.

    o	Added the following resource variable message specificiers:

	    TEND		Last message of current discussion
				thread.
	    TTOP		Top/root message of current discussion
				thread.

    o	Changes to readmail.pl:
	-   %Cid hash keys are now URLs.  Content-Ids are denoted
	    as "cid:..."  Hash also contains Content-Location values
	    of message parts.  This allows filters (like the HTML
	    filter) to check for external URL references where
	    the data for the reference is included with the message.
	-   More robust handling of malformed multipart messages.

    o	The null filter is applied to application/ms-tnef by default.

    o	Lowercase tag names are now used in default resource values
	that contain HTML markup.

    o	Bug fixes to the documentation.


    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
04/24/2000	(2.4.6)

    o	Stricter check is made when decoded quoted-printable data.
	An escape sequence is only converted to a raw character if
	a it is a valid escape sequence.  I.e.  Any '=' not followed
	by two hexadecimal characters is left as-is.

    o	Call to Digest::MD5::md5_hex() wrapped in eval block in
	case of bad installations of Digest::MD5 module.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
02/14/2000	(2.4.5)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Following changes to m2h_text_html::filter:
	-   All comment declarations are removed.  This avoid
	    potential SSI attacks and declarations that may conflict
	    with MHonArc.
	-   Additional tags have been added to the to-strip list
	    to avoid potential client-side scripting attacks.  See
	    MIMEFILTERS docs for list.
	-   Added "nofont" option to strip out any <font> tags.

    o	Added application/x-bzip2 to known mime types (mhmimetypes.pl).

    o	Simple modification to get_time_from_date() in mhutil.pl to
	handle abhorrent case of message date using a 2 digit year.

    o	Under VMS, the default lock file name has been changed to
	"mhonarc_lck" for directory based locking will work.

    o	mhonarc::htmlize/entify now translates the double-quote
	character (") to &quot;.

    o	Added VARREGEX resource to allow customization of resource
	variable matching.  Mainly for use with resource files written
	on multibyte charsets like SJIS.  Use with caution.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
10/01/1999	(2.4.4)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Added the following resources:
    
	    MIMEDECODERS	Content-Transfer-Encoding decoding
				functions.

    o	Added the following resource variables:

	    $PGLINKLIST$	Print out a list of index page links.

    o	New content filter for message/external-body.

    o	Message/delivery-status content handled by mhtxtplain.pl

    o	Support for "Zone[+-]DDDD" timezone specification.

    o	MAILparse_parameter_str() function added to readmail.pl.
	Function supports parsing parameter value strings with support
	for RFC 2184 extensions.  Function added to provide
	support for message/external-body filter.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
08/15/1999	(2.4.3)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Added the following resources:

	    POSIXSTRFTIME	Use POSIX::strftime() or not for
				processing time format strings

    o	The "latin[1-6]" character sets defined in the default
	value of CHARSETCONVERTERS.   iso8859::str2sgml modified
	to use proper iso8859 map for specified latin[1-6]
	specification.

    o	The text/html filter now strips out scripting markup by
	default.  To allow scripting markup to be preserved, the
	"allowscript" option can be used.

    o	Unknown media-types are now treated as application/octet-stream,
	which will invoke the application/octet-stream filter.
	Because of this, an explicit entry for application/octet-stream
	has been added to the default value of MIMEFILTERS.

    o	If in a multipart/alternative entity, and no known media-types
	exists, the last part is treated as application/octet-stream.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
08/11/1999	(2.4.2)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Added the following resources:

	    STDIN		Source for standard input

    o	Added the following resource variables:

	    $ENV$		Print an environment variable

    o	Added support for decoding uuencoded data within text
	messages in mhtxtplain.pl.  Decoding activated via the
	"uudecode" option.

    o	For processing time format strings, POSIX::strftime() is
	used, if available.  If not, MHonArc implementation is
	used.

    o	The default value of FROMFIELDS now includes "return-path".

    o	Description section moved before Options section in -help
	message.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
07/25/1999	(2.4.1)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Added the following resources:

	    MSGEXCFILTER	Perl expressions for excluding
				messages from archive.
	    SAVERESOURCES	Flag if resource values should be
				saved in database.

    o	Added the following resource variables:

	    $HTMLEXT$		Value of HTMLEXT resource.

    o	Documentation corrections an additions.

    o	Use of typeglobs removed from mhdb.pl.

    o	mhtime.pl explicitly defined in mhonarc package.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
06/25/1999	(2.4.0)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	Added the following resources:

	    ADDRESSMODIFYCODE	Perl expressions to apply to addresses
				during message header conversion.
	    CHECKNOARCHIVE	Check "no archive" flag in messages.
	    LOCKMETHOD		The type of archive locking performed.
	    SPAMMODE		Perform actions to deter email address
				harvesters.
	    SSMARKUP		Markup at the *very* beginning of any
				generated page.
	    STDOUT		Destination of stdout messages/data.
	    STDERR		Destination of stderr messages/data.
	    SUBJECTTHREADS	To check, or not to check, subjects when
				computing threads.

    o	Added the following resource variables:

	    $FROMADDRNAME$	Username portion of From email address.
	    $FROMADDRDOMAIN$	Domain portion of From email address.
	    $TOADDRNAME$	Username portion of an email address
				(applicable in MAILTOURL only).
	    $TOADDRDOMAIN$	Domain portion of an email address
				(applicable in MAILTOURL only).

    o	A new utility program: mha-decode.  The program functions
	as a MIME message decoder.  Can be used against mail folders
	or single messages.

    o	The "PARENT" argument to applicable resource variables is now
	called "TPARENT".  This change should not affect anyone since
	the "PARENT" argument did not work properly in previous
	releases.

    o	SUBJECTHEADER and HEADBODYSEP resource changes will now affect
	existing messages that are edited during normal operations or
	via EDITIDX.  Note, messages created from old versions of
	MHonArc may not be affected.

    o	The default TIMEZONES settings now has a more complete list.

    o	Timezone acronym settings now support [+-]HHMM specifications.

    o	Support for ISO-2022-JP encoded strings in message headers
	is now supported.  It does assume that HTML viewer supports
	ISO-2022-JP.

    o	If Digest::MD5 is installed, md5_hex() will be used to create
	message-ids for messages without message-ids.  This allows
	MHonArc to ignore non-message-id archived messages in ADD mode.
	The MD5 digest is computed only on message header for efficieny.
	If Digest::MD5 is not installed, a message-id will still be
	assigned if none present, but MHonArc will not be able to
	detect if message has already been archived in subsequent ADD
	operations.

    o	Text/html filter supports the "noscript" option.  If
	specified, any script-related markup will be removed.
	This provides added security to avoid sites being compromised
	with foreign client-side scripting.

    o	Added the following options to mhexternal.pl (the save-to-file
	filter): forceattach, forceinline, and inlineexts.

    o	Recognize mailing list headers as defined by RFC 2369 and
	hyperlink URLs listed.

    o	If no boundaries exist in a multipart message (even though
	a boundary is defined in the header), MHonArc will treat
	the entire body as the first part.  This prevents "unable
	to process" warnings.

    o	The "<!--X-From" comment declaration at the top of converted
	messages is now munged by a modified ROT13 to facilitate
	anti-spam-bot measures, but still provide the "From"
	information for mha-dbrecover.

    o	When editing message pages, the new version of the page is now
	created as a temporary file and then if successfully created,
	it will get renamed to its proper name.  This help avoids "losing"
	a message page if there is an error during page editing.  The
	same method is applied to the dumping of DBFILE.

    o	Message sorting modified to improve sorting performance when
	sorting by subject and author.

    o	URL matching expression in mhtxtplain.pl modified to handle
	'&' characters.

=======================================================================
11/01/1998	(2.3.2)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    o	A new (improved) install.me program to do the installation.
	See INSTALL for more information.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
10/25/1998	(2.3.1)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------
    Please read the RELNOTES file for important information regarding
    upgrading to v2.2.x, or later, from pre-v2.2 releases.

    o	Support for MHTML.  I.e.  An HTML document that references data
	included as other parts to the mail message, will be converted
	so the data will be shown where referenced.  Before, all
	referenced data was shown at the end of the message.

    o	Auto-computing the name for attachments no longer caches
	data, so performance may decrease when processing MIME
	messages.  This change is required since multiple filters can
	now write data to files and not all to the same directory (a
	common utility function now exists for writing data to a file).
	Also, it avoids behavioral problems with custom front-ends
	that operate on multiple archives in a single process.

    o	Changes to readmail.pl inorder to support MHTML.  Changes
	done should help the handling of other multipart/related
	data types.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
10/10/1998	(2.3.0)

    o	Perl 5 is now required to run MHonArc.  Although the code
	base is still "Perl 4-style", many changes made use of Perl 5
	constructs.

    o	New utility programs added to the dustribution:

	    mha-dbedit		- Make resource/db changes w/o touching
				  pages.
	    mha-dbrecover	- Rebuild database from HTML message
				  files.

    o	Many resource variables have been changed to take arguments
	to control what values the variables will expand to.  Because,
	of this, many variables are now deprecated.  However, old
	forms of resource variables are still recognized.

	See the documentation for more information on resource
	variables (a new section on resource variables has been
	added to the documentation) and the newer syntax.

    o	New resources:

	    AFS			- Skip archive directory permission check
	    ANNOTATE		- Annotate message(s).
	    LOCK		- To lock, or not to lock.
	    MSGPGS		- Print, or not, message pages.
	    NOTE		- Annotate markup.
	    NOTEIA		- Inactive annotate markup.
	    NOTEDIR		- Directory where annotations are located.
	    NOTETEXT		- Annotation text.
	    PAGENUM		- Page to output when using GENIDX with
				  MULTIPG.
	    READDB		- Just load the database
				  (useful for application front-ends).
	    USELOCALTIME	- Use localtime to determine day groups in
				  date index listing.

    o	New resource variables:

	    $DDMMYYYY$		- Day/Mon/Year(4 digit)
	    $MMDDYYYY$		- Mon/Day/Year(4 digit)
	    $MSG$		- Filename of message page
	    $SORTTYPE$		- Type of sort in use for main index
	    $TSORTTYPE$		- Type of sort in use for thread index
	    $YYYYMMDD$		- Year(4 digit)/Mon/Day

	Note, many other variables have been changed.  See docs for
	more information.

    o	Added "J" modifier for resource variables.  When specified,
	escapes quote characters so expanded values can be used
	within JavaScript strings.

    o	Added "usenameext" option to mhexternal.pl filter.  When
	specified, mhexternal.pl will use the filename specified in
	the message for determining the filename extension to use.

    o	The -rcfile option can be specified multiple times.  Resource
	files specified are read in the order specified.

    o	The -definevars options has been deprecated in favor of
	-definevar (no ending 's').  -definevar can be specified
	multiple times on the command-line.  The usaage of it is
	exactly the same as -definevars.  The -definevars is still
	supported for backwards compatibility.

    o	The -perlinc option can be specified multiple times.

    o	For the mhtxtplain.pl filter, the TARGET attribute for links is
	now specified only if the target option is specified.

    o	MHonArc is now smarter when the RMM resource is used.  MHonArc
	will now only update pages that are required when messages
	are removed instead of doing a force update on all pages.
	RMM operations will now perform much faster.

    o	Subject based replies are *no longer* treated as a separate
	"group" when printing thread index pages.  I.e.  Subject based
	replies no longer cause a separate TSUBLISTBEG and TSUBLISTEND
	to be invoked.	Before, it was a problem if the HTML OL
	element was used.  OL numbering would restart when subject
	based replies were printed.

    o	GENIDX now supports the use of MULTIPG (w/IDXSIZE).

    o	MHonArc uses rename instead of file copying when editing
	pages.  Should provide a speed increase when editing archive
	pages.

    o	Reason when a file cannot be opened or created is printed
	($! is now included in the error message).

    o	If unable to lock an archive (and -force not specified),
	MHonArc will now return an exit status of 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL).
	This is for the benefit of MTAs (like sendmail) where
	MHonArc is called via an alias.

    o	Some changes to code to make it suitable for MHonArc to be
	embedded into other Perl programs.  The most significant
	changes was to make it possible to process more than one
	archive in a single process instance (note, archives can
	only be processed in sequence and not in parallel).  Now it
	easier to write different application front-ends to MHonArc.

    o	Some other code cleanup in the hopes to improve performance.

=======================================================================
03/03/1998	(2.2.0)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------

	o  New resource

		MSGIDLINK	  - Hyperlink markup for message-ids
		SUBJECTARTICLERXP - Regex to match articles (a,an,the)
				    in subject text.
		SUBJECTREPLYRXP	  - Regex to match reply annotation
				    in subject text.
		TSLICE		  - Set the size of a thread slice listing
		TSLICEBEG	  - Begin markup of a thread slice listing
		TSLICEEND	  - End markup of a thread slice listing

	o  New resource variables

		$TSLICE$	  - Print thread listing slice relative to
				    current message.

	o  Added default=charset option to mhtxtplain.pl filter.

	o  Added mhtxttsv.pl to handle text/tab-separated-values
	   content.

	o  Expanded list of recognized content-types in mhexternal.pl.

	o  Changed loading of decoders, charset convertes, and
	   content-type filters to be done on demand.  Should
	   provide an increase in start-up time.

	o  Modified source so no Perl structures are in the "main"
	   package.  The base package is now "mhonarc".  This
	   should make it easier for incorporating mhonarc into
	   another Perl program.

	   *IMPORTANT*: This change causes changes to db file format.
	   See release notes on how to upgrade pre v2.2 archives.

	o  Main routines are now located in mhamain.pl.  The main
	   mhonarc source file now just requires mhamain.pl and
	   just calls two main functions.

	o  Although code should still be Perl 4 compatible, Perl
	   related resource documentation now puts preference to
	   Perl 5 notations (eg: MIMEFILTERS, CHARSETCONVERTERS).

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
02/23/1998	(2.1.2)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------

	o  Added the following resources:

		ARCHIVE   	Create archive files
		FROMFIELDS	Define fields to extract "FROM"
		USINGLASTPG	Is $LASTPG$ in use

	o  Removed (almost) all uses of $& in code.  Still used
	   in readmail.pl for decoding non-ASCII encoded text.

	o  Changed the default value of CHARSETCONVERTS resource.
	   The plain, us-ascii, and iso-8859-1 charsets now
	   default to main::htmlize.  This provided a significant
	   performance improvement when process a large amount of
	   input.

	o  Moved thread related routines into a file called
	   mhthread.pl.

	o  MIMEFILTERS, MIMEARGS, and CHARSETCONVERTS resources
	   support Perl 5 package qualification in function names
	   if a semi-colon is used instead of a colon as the
	   list values separator.

	o  Probably some other changes I forgot about.

=======================================================================
02/18/1998	(2.1.1)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------

	o  Added DATEFIELDS resource.  The resource allows the user to
	   specify the fields (and order) that are checked when
	   MHonArc extracts the date of a message.

	o  RMM can now take message number ranges and/or message-ids.

	o  Added $FROMADDR$ variable for MAILTOURL resource.

	o  Message-id printed in warning about unable to parse date.
	   Helps users locate offending message.

	o  'No Author' used if no message sender is not present.

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
06/09/97	(2.1.0)

    Enhancements/Changes
    --------------------

	o  Added the following resources:

		DEFRCNAME	Base name of default resource file
		FOLUPBEGIN	Begin markup for message follow-ups
		FOLUPEND	End markup for message follow-ups
		FOLUPLITXT	Markup for follow-up list entry
		GZIPEXE		Pathname of gzip executable
		GZIPFILES	Gzip files
		GZIPLINKS	Add ".gz" to filenames in URLs
		HTMLEXT		HTML extension for files
		MSGBODYEND	Markup at end of converted message body
		MSGPREFIX	Prefix for message filenames
		REFSBEGIN	Begin markup for message references
		REFSEND 	End markup for message references
		REFSLITXT	Markup for reference list entry
		TSORT		Sort threads by date or message number
		TSUBSORT	Sort threads by subject

	o  Changes to mhexternal.pl filter:
	
	    -  Two new options: useicons and iconurl="url".
	    -  Added some more content-types to CTExt hash.

	o  Added filter for text/enriched data (mhtxtenrich.pl).

	o  Changed default setting for MIMEFILTERS.  The following
	   was added:

	    model/*:m2h_external'filter:mhexternal.pl
	    text/enriched:m2h_text_enriched'filter:mhtxtenrich.pl
	    text/richtext:m2h_text_enriched'filter:mhtxtenrich.pl

	o  Some code moved to new library files (mhopt.pl,
	   mhfile.pl).

05/23/97	(2.0.1)

    Bug Fixes
    ---------
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
05/16/97	(2.0.0)

    Enhancements:

	o  Added TCONTBEGIN, TCONTEND, TINDENTBEGIN, TINDENTEND
	   resources.  They are provided to support the formatting
	   of threads that split across multiple pages of a
	   multipage index.

	o  Added "nonfixed", "maxwidth", and "keepspace" options
	   to text/plain (mhtxtplain.pl) filter.

	o  A directory file is now used for performing archive
	   locking.  This should provide better portability across
	   operating systems.

	o  Dervied files returned from filters can be directories.
	   If so, the any directory is completely removed if the
	   message is removed.

	o  The mhexternal.pl filter can now output files into
	   a subdirectory with the "subdir" option.  This may be
	   useful for those wanting to use the "usename" option
	   and avoid potential filename conflicts.

	o  The $NEXT...$ and $PREV...$ resource variables now
	   behave as one may expect.  I.e.  The are always relative
	   to the base sort method: date, author, subject, message
	   number.  The REVERSE resource has no effect on their
	   values.  Therefore, the variables no longer refer to
	   the actual physical listing order.  This new behavior
	   no longer requires a users to redefine button and link
	   resources for the sake of specifying REVERSE.

	o  "Resent-To" and "Resent-Cc" will now have e-mail
	   address hyperlinked.

	o  Unknown types processed by mhexternal.pl now default
	   to have a ".bin" extension.  This should cause HTTP
	   servers to treat the file as application/octet-stream.

	o  Standard input can be specified as the source of a
	   mailbox by using a lone "-" on the command-line.  Note:
	   You may need to specify "--" first to shut-off option
	   processing so the "-" is not interpreted as the start
	   of an option.

    Bug Fixes:
    See BUGS.

=======================================================================
02/28/97	(2.0.0 beta 3)

	o  Removed bogus call to output_db() when GENIDX is active.
	   The routine is not loaded when GENIDX is active and the
	   call causes Perl to abort.

	o  Duplicates of the OTHERINDEXES resource should no longer
	   occur.  Before, if the OTHERINDEXES resource gets set
	   during invocation, mhonarc would store duplicate values,
	   causing unnecessary work to be performed.

	o  Fixed problem with blank indexes being created for
	   OTHERINDEXES.  Apparently, there is a bug in Perl, and
	   a work-around fix has been done.

	o  Fixed bug where an extra TSUBLISTEND could get generated.

=======================================================================
02/17/97	(2.0.0 beta 2)

	o  Added <nosubsort> element and -nosubsort option.

	o  Changed M2H_DATEFMT envariable to M2H_GMTDATEFMT.

	o  Documented LOCKTRIES and LOCKDELAY resources.

	o  New resources:

		AUTHORBEGIN	- Markup for start of author group
		AUTHOREND	- Markup for end of author group
		AUTHSORT	- Sort messages by author
		DAYBEGIN	- Markup for start of day group
		DAYEND  	- Markup for end of day group
		IDXLABEL	- Label for main index
		MSGGMTDATEFMT	- Format of $MSGGMTDATE$
		MSGLOCALDATEFMT	- Format of $MSGLOCALDATE$
		SUBJECTBEGIN	- Markup for start of subject group
		SUBJECTEND	- Markup for end of subject group
		TIDXLABEL	- Label for thread index

	o  New resource variables
		
		$IDXLABEL$	- Label for main index
		$MSGGMTDATE$	- Date of message in GMT format
		$MSGLOCALDATE$	- Date of message in local format
		$TIDXLABEL$	- Label for thread index

	o  Some enhancements to the documentation.

	o  Some code changes.

=======================================================================
01/31/97	(2.0.0 beta 1)

	o  RFC 1522 support.  Charset filters can be plugged in to
	   handle character sets not recognized by mhonarc.
	   The library, iso8859.pl, contains charset filters for
	   character sets iso-8859-[1-10].

	o  Multi-page index generation.

	o  Subject-based threading is done inconjunction with explicit
	   threading.

	o  Missing messages in a thread are recognized when processing
	   messages that utilize the References field.

	o  New resources for customizing thread indexes.  There is
	   now complete user control on how thread indexes are
	   formatted.

	o  Resource are available to access the next and previous messages
	   in thread from messages.

	o  Inclusion of files containing resource settings can be
	   done within a resource file.

	o  Support for a default resource file.  The default resource
	   file is one of the following, in the order of precedence:

		1. File specified by the M2H_DEFRCFILE envariable
		2. $HOME/.mhonarc.rc
		3. <Install-Library-Dir>/.mhonarc.rc

	   "<Install-Library-Dir>" is the path of the MHonArc library
	   directory defined during installation.  For MS-DOS, replace
	   ".mhonarc.rc" with "MHONARC.RC".

	o  Support for user defined resource variables.

	o  Support for user defined derived files for messages.

	o  Support for the Content-Length field.

	o  Modification time of messages, and derived files, can be
	   set to the Received/Date time specified in the message.

	o  More control on how mail headers get formatted.

	o  Added filter in mhexternal.pl to be the default filter
	   for main content-types: application, image, video, audio.

	o  List of enhancements to mhexternal.pl:
	
		- Show content-type if the data is not recognized.
		- New `ext' filter option to define the extension to
		  use for the created file.
		- New `type' filter option to define the "english"
		  type name of the create file.
		- Content-Disposition is supported.  Filenames are
		  ignored still unless `usename' argument passed to
		  filter.
		- Added recognition of few more content-types

	o  Updated date parsing to figure out the date of a message to be
	   more robust on how it parses a date.  If unable to parse
	   date, the message will take on the current time for sorting
	   purposes.  Also, character case is ignored in month and weekday
	   names.

	o  The comment declaration "<!--X-Body-of-Message-->" is
	   now inserted between the message header and body.  Helps
	   in the building of some search indexes to restrict searches
	   on message data.

	o  Many resource settings are no longer stored in database if
	   the resource is the default value.  Save some disk space and
	   allows resources to self adjust when a dependent resource is
	   changed.

	o  The text/plain filter in mhtxtplain.pl has the following
	   enhancements:
	   
	       -  Check for charset to control character conversion.
	       -  Integrated iso-2022-jp filter (keys off charset)
	       -  Filter option "quote" cause quoted text in message
		  to be italicized.
	       -  Filter option "asis" defines a list of charsets to
		  not convert to sgml entitites.  Example usage:

			asis=iso-8859-1:iso-8859-2

	o  mhtxt2022.pl has been removed since the code has been
	   integrated into mhtxtplain.pl.

	o  Resource file elements that have textual content (ie. no
	   line oriented content) can specify the "chop" attribute
	   to have the last end-of-line stripped from the content.
	   Example usage:

		<nextbuttonia chop>
		[Next]
		</nextbuttonia>

	o  Fixed bug in creating links of message-ids.  Mhonarc blindingly
	   made links of message-ids when editting messages w/o
	   consideration that the message-ids may already be linked.  This
	   caused markup like the following to occur:

	    <A HREF="..."><A HREF="..."><A HREF="...">...</A></A></A>...

	   Browsers handle the invalid markup with no problems, causing
	   the bug to go unnoticed for a long time.  Now, only new
	   added message-ids are scanned for when creating links.

	o  $readmail'FieldSep should now be used instead of $FieldSep
	   for separating duplicate fields in a parsed message header.

	o  The -scan output now prints a 4 digit year.

	o  Bogus space no longer appears in subjects and dates.

	o  Outdir permissions are not checked if -single specified.

	o  Some internal changes to how data is stored in databases
	   (needed for 1522 support).  v2.0 will automatically
	   modify 1.x databases to the 2.0 format.

	o  The -single option utilizes the same mail output routine
	   utilized by regular archive processing.

	o  MhonArc will now handle numbers with leading zeros when
	   the -rmm option is specified.

	o  New resources:

		CHARSETCONVERTERS
				- Specify character set filters
		CONLEN		- Honor content-lengths
		DECODEHEADS	- Decode 1522 encoded data, set for decode
				  only, as message headers are read (see

	   NOTE
	       1522 processing is done when creating HTML output and
	       the (relevant) data stored in the database stays in
	       encoded form.  The DECODEHEADS resource can be set
	       to decode decode-only charsets when message headers
	       are read.  Hence, the decode-only charsets will be
	       stored in decoded form.	Regular 1522 processing is
	       still done to still-encoded data when generating output.
	       The default is NODECODEHEADS.

	o  List of removed resources:

		NOTSUBSORT, TSUBSORT

	o  New resource variables:
	   (NOTE: Some variables are only valid in certain contexts)

		$FIRSTPG$	- Filename of first page of main index
		$IDXPREFIX$	- Prefix to main index pages' filenames

		$TPREVPG$	- Filename of previous thread index page
		$TPREVPGLINK$	- Link to previous page of thread index
		$TPREVSUBJECT$	- Previous mesg subject in thread

	o  Removed resources:

		NOTSUBSORT, TSUBSORT

	o  Some changes to default resource settings.

	o  Reorganized code.  Some new libraries have been created
	   to help in maintenance.

	o  Source code has been put under SCCS revision control.

=======================================================================
07/12/96	(1.2.3)

	o  Extracted initialization of data structures into mhinit.pl.
	   The file is just required from the main source.

	o  Use q{} instead of qq{} when trying to read database file.
	   Should fix require problem under MS-DOS.

	o  Added <!--X-Reference-Id: ... --> comments at beginning
	   of messages.  May aid in database recovery techniques.

	o  ';'s are now deleted in filenames in mhexternal.pl
	   (applicable only when "usename" option specified)

	o  Added recognition of '/' when converted e-mail addresses
	   to mailto links in message headers.

	o  Simple fix to mhtxt2022.pl for execution under Perl 5.

=======================================================================
04/18/96	(1.2.2)

	o  Increased the speed performance of base64 decoding.  Speed
	   increase is much greater under Perl 4 than Perl 5.

	o  Added -time option to print out total CPU execution time.
	   Mainly used for debugging reasons (like checking on
	   base64 decoding times).  Time information is sent to
	   standard error.

	o  Added M2H_LOCKDELAY envariable and -lockdelay option.
	   Either can be used to adjust the sleep time between
	   attempts to lock the archive.

	o  Added -force option to override a lock on an archive if
	   attempts to lock fail.

	o  Added image/x-bmp and image/x-pcx to the default supported
	   MIME types.

	o  Ignore "Sv:" at the beginning of subjects when sorting by
	   subject.  "Sv:" is Danish for "Re:".

	o  Fixed bug in mhutil.pl where TIDXPGEND actually set
	   TIDXPGBEG.

	o  Dynamically define exclude_field routine after reading
	   user options.  exclude_field is utilized when formatting
	   a message header in HTML.  Defining the routine at run-time
	   helps reduce the regular expression overhead the old version
	   of the routine entailed.  There should be an increase in
	   overall execution time.

=======================================================================
03/22/96	(1.2.1)

	o  Added support for x-uuencode content-transfer-encoding.

	o  Added -locktries command-line option.

	o  Added the resource variable $OUTDIR$.

	o  mhexternal.pl filter will use the name parameter string
	   on the content-type field as the anchor text to the file
	   if there is no content-description.

	o  application/x-patch is recognized and processed by the
	   text/plain filter (mhtxtplain.pl).

	o  Fixed bug in install.me and osinit.pl where setting
	   $'PROG caused perl to terminate if $'DIRSEP was a backslash
	   (occured under MS-DOS usage).

	o  Fixed bug in install.me in the create_dir routine.
	   If $DIRSEP was a backslash, the regular expression setting
	   @a would cause perl to abort with an error.

	o  Fixed database bug where the MIMEARGS resource setting
	   was not being stored.

	o  Fixed index listing bug where a reverse listing was not
	   correct if an index size was specified less than the
	   current size of the archive.

=======================================================================
03/01/96	(1.2.0)

	o  Rewrote message parser routine so it will work under Perl 5
	   for multipart messages.  The rewrite also allows some
	   additional features that are mentioned below.

	o  The -mbox and -mh options are no longer required.  MHonArc
	   will automatically determine which mode to operate in
	   based upon the file arguments.  Hence, one can specify
	   MH folders and mailbox files on the same command-line.
	   Both options are ignored if specified.

	o  An HTML index of an archive contents can be generated to
	   standard output (-genidx).

	o  Message header lines not conforming to RFC 822 are ignored.
	   (Eg: Those pesky "From " lines should not show up anymore --
	    please do not confuse this with the regular "From:" lines;
	    note the colon vs the space).

	o  New resources:

		BOTLINKS	- May be used to completely customize
				  the links at the bottom of messages.
		IDXPGBEGIN	- Opening markup for main index page.
				  Allows one to redefine opening HTML
				  element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
				  opening BODY element, etc.
		IDXPGEND	- Closing markup for main index page.
		IDXSIZE		- Set the maximum number of messages
				  listed in index.  This is different
				  in MAXSIZE where MAXSIZE will remove
				  older messages when the MAXSIZE limit
				  is reached in the archive.
		MIMEARGS	- Define arguments to filters
		MSGPGBEGIN	- Opening markup for message pages.
				  Allows one to redefine opening HTML
				  element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
				  opening BODY element, etc.
		MSGPGEND	- Closing markup for message pages.
		NEXTBUTTON	- Defines the 'Next' button.
		NEXTBUTTONIA	- Defines the 'Next' button when it is
				  inactive.
		NEXTLINK	- Defines the 'Next' link.
		NEXTLINKIA	- Defines the 'Next' link when it is
				  inactive.
		NOTSUBSORT	- Do not sort threads by subject.
		OTHERINDEXES	- List other resource files defining
				  other indexes to create when creating,
				  or updating, an archive.
		PREVBUTTON	- Defines the 'Prev' button.
		PREVBUTTONIA	- Defines the 'Prev' button when it is
				  inactive.
		PREVLINK	- Defines the 'Prev' link.
		PREVLINKIA	- Defines the 'Prev' link when it is
				  inactive.
		TIDXPGBEGIN	- Opening markup for thread index page.
				  Allows one to redefine opening HTML
				  element, HEAD element, TITLE element,
				  opening BODY element, etc.
		TIDXPGEND	- Closing markup for thread index page.
		TOPLINKS	- May be used to completely customize
				  the buttons at the top of messages.
		TSUBSORT	- Sort threads listed by subject.

	o  Removed resources:

		INDEXBL, INDEXFL, MBOX, MH, NEXTBL, NEXTFL, PREVBL,
		PREVFL, TINDEXBL, TINDEXFL

	   Resource were removed because they were no longer applicable
	   and/or have been superceded by other resources.  MHonArc
	   will still honor old resource settings (where applicable) of
	   older archives and incorporate them into the new resource
	   settings.

	o  When specifying the resource file, mhonarc will now do
	   the following to determine its location:

		1.  If its an absolute pathname, mhonarc uses it.
		2.  If it is a relative pathname, mhonarc checks for
		    it relative to the current working directory.
		3.  Otherwise, mhonarc checks for it relative to
		    location of the archive as specified by outdir.

	   This resolution will allow you to place resource files with
	   the archive if desired (can be useful when using the
	   OTHERINDEXES resource element).

	o  Because of the new resources available, many <HR>'s are no
	   longer hard-coded and are controllable by resources.  <HR>'s
	   are still used in message pages to separate message data
	   from mhonarc data.

	o  Added resource variables:
	   (NOTE: Some variables are only valid in certain contexts)

		$DDMMYY$	- Date of message in dd/mm/yy format
		$IDXSIZE$	- Max size of index list
		$MMDDYY$	- Date of message in mm/dd/yy format
		$MSGID$		- Message id
		$NEXTBUTTON$	- Next button markup
		$NEXTFROM$	- From field of next listed message
		$NEXTFROMADDR$	- From e-mail address of next listed message
		$NEXTFROMNAME$	- From name of next listed message
		$NEXTLINK$	- Next link markup
		$NEXTMSGNUM$	- Number of next listed message
		$NEXTSUBJECT$	- Subject text of next listed message
		$NUMOFIDXMSG$	- Number of messages in index list
		$PREVBUTTON$	- Previous button markup
		$PREVFROM$	- From field of previous listed message
		$PREVFROMADDR$	- From e-mail address of prev listed message
		$PREVFROMNAME$	- From name of previous listed message
		$PREVLINK$	- Previous link markup
		$PREVMSGNUM$	- Number of previous message
		$PREVSUBJECT$	- Subject text of previous listed message
		$YYMMDD$	- Date of message in yy/mm/dd format

	o  Can specify a 'U' with variable length specifier to denote
	   replacement string is to be used in a URL.  Examples:

		$SUBJECTNA:40U$
		$MSGID:U$

	   The 'U' causes the replace text to have special characters
	   escaped as denoted by the URL spec.  NOTE: Specify ":U"
	   should NOT be used in the MAILTOURL resource; the variables
	   will automatically be expanded according to the URL spec.
	   Specifyind ":U" or a length specifier in the MAILTOURL
	   resource will prevent mhonarc from detecting the variable.

	o  New command-line options:

		-genidx		- Generate HTML index of archive contents
				  to stdout.
		-idxsize	- Maximum number of messages shown in indexes
		-notsubsort	- Do not sort threads listed by subject.
		-savemem	- Write message data while processing
		-tsubsort	- Sort threads listed by subject.

	o  The library mhtxt2022.pl has been added that provides
	   a filter to process ISO-2022 (Japanese) encoded mail messages.
	   See mhtxt2022.pl on how to hook it in.

	o  The mhexternal.pl filter by default ignores any filename
	   specification in the message for creating derived files.
	   This avoids name conflicts and security problems.
	   The "usename" filter option may be used to override this.

	o  Mime filters are now called with two additional arguments:

		$converted_data = &function(
			$header, *parsed_header_assoc_array,
			*message_data, $decoded_flag,
			$optional_filter_arguments);

	   The $decoded_flag is set to 1 if the *message_data has been
	   decoded.  $optional_filter_arguments contains an optional
	   argument string as determined by the filter.

	o  Mime filters can now be registered for multipart types
	   and message types.  This allows one to override mhonarc's
	   conversion of these types, and completely replace mhonarc's
	   message->HTML conversion process.

	o  Mime filters should now use $'FieldSep instead of $'X for
	   accessing parsed message headers.

	o  Mime filters can be registered for a base type.  Ie.
	   It is no longer required to explicitly list each possible
	   subtype if a single filter is to be used for them all.
	   Example:

		<mimefilters>
		image/*:myfilter'imagefilter:myfilter.pl
		</mimefilters>

	   Registers "myfilter'filter" for all image data types,
	   regardless of subtype.  However, if an explicit entry
	   exists for a subtype, then that filter is called.
	   Example:

		<mimefilters>
		image/*:myfilter'imagefilter:myfilter.pl
		image/gif:myfilter'giffilter:myfilter.pl
		</mimefilters>

	   "myfilter'giffilter" is called for all image/gif data.
	   "myfilter'imagefilter" is called for all other image data.

	o  A new resource, MIMEARGS, may be used to pass optional arguments
	   to filters to control their behavior.  The format of the
	   argument string is controlled by the various filters.  The
	   arguments can be specified by a specific content-type, or
	   for the filter routine in general.  A content-type argument
	   will be used over any arguments specified for a filter.

	   Example usage:

		<mimeargs>
		image/gif:inline usename
		m2h_external'filter:usename
		</mimeargs>

	   See the documentation for possible arguments to filters.

	o  Installation program can now be invoked in batch mode.

	o  Thread index properly includes docurl as main index.
	   -nodocurl will prevent the inclusion as with the main index.

	o  Fixed bug in mhtxthtml.pl on properly propogating a base
	   URL to relative URLs starting with a "/".

	o  Fixed bug where single quotes, and backslashed in keys of
	   associative arrays in the database file were not getting
	   escaped.

	o  Fixed bug where spaces and special characters were not
	   properly escaped in URL strings: spaces were left as-is,
	   and special characters were deleted.

	o  Removed illegal invocation choices in the Synopsis of the
	   documentation.

=======================================================================
04/24/95	(1.1.1)

	o  Fixed bug in -scan output where month in date was off by
	   one.

=======================================================================
04/21/95	(1.1.0)

	o  Made modifications to make MHonArc suitable to run
	   under MS-DOS without modification.  MHonArc will
	   automatically detect if it is running under Unix or MS-DOS.

	o  Added support for a thread index.  MHonArc will create a
	   complimentary index to the main index showing message
	   threads.

	o  Archive messages can be deleted.

	o  A listing to stdout of an archives contents can be
	   generated.

	o  Maximum number of messages for an archive can be set.
	   Older messages (based on sort method) are removed
	   automatically during add operations.

	o  MHonArc will now recognize if you try to add in a message
	   that already exists in an archive.

	o  The -editdx option will now also cause a updating of all
	   mail messages.  Guarantees resource changes to affect all
	   messages.

	o  Added the following resource file elements:

		MSGFOOT		-- Footer text for converted messages
		MSGHEAD		-- Header text for converted messages
		NODOC		-- Do not put link to documentation
		NOTHREAD	-- Do not create thread index
		TFOOT		-- Text at bottom of thread index page
		THEAD		-- Text at top of thread index page
		THREAD		-- Create thread index
		TLEVELS		-- Depth of thread listing
		TLITXT		-- Template text for entry in thread
				   index
		TIDXFNAME	-- Thread index filename
		TINDEXBL	-- Top button label in messages to
				   thread index
		TINDEXFL	-- Verbose label in message to thread
				   index
		TTITLE		-- Title of thread index page

	o  Added the following command-line options:

		-maxsize	-- Maxinum # messages in an archive
		-nodoc		-- Do not put link to documentation
		-nothread	-- Do not create thread index
		-rmm		-- Remove messages from an archive
		-scan		-- Listing of archive to stdout
		-thread		-- Create thread index
		-tidxfname	-- Thread index filename
		-tlevels	-- Depth of thread listing
		-ttitle		-- Title of thread index page

	o  Added the following environment variables:

		M2H_MAXSIZE	-- Maxinum # messages in an archive
		M2H_THREAD	-- If non-zero, create thread index
		M2H_TIDXFNAME	-- Thread index filename
		M2H_TLEVELS	-- Depth of thread listing
		M2H_TTITLE	-- Title of thread index page

	o  Added the following variables for template resources
	   (applicability of variables vary depending on the resource):

		$DOCURL$	-- URL to documentation
		$IDXFNAME$	-- Main index page filename
		$IDXTITLE$	-- Main index page title
		$NEXTMSG$	-- Next message filename
		$PREVMSG$	-- Previous message filename
		$PROG$		-- Program name
		$TIDXFNAME$	-- Thread index page filename
		$TIDXTITLE$	-- Thread index page title
		$VERSION$	-- Version number of the program

	o  Added $FROM$, $MSGID$, and $SUBJECT$ variables to be used
	   in the MAILTOURL resource.

	o  The string `$$' in template resources will produce a `$' in
	   the output.

	o  Fixed problem with messages (with follow-ups) getting
	   unnecessarily updated when messages are added to an archive.

	o  Only a CR/LF, or LF, pair will terminate a message head.
	   Before, MHonArc was terminating message heads when
	   encountering an empty line or a line that only contained
	   whitespace (which was incorrect behavior).

	o  Fixed bug in mhexternal.pl dealing with the `name' parameter
	   in the content-type field.  Surrounding "s or 's were not
	   being deleted causing filenames with quotes to be written.

	o  mhexternal.pl: The head of a pathname in the `name'
	   parameter in the content-type field is stripped off before
	   writing the external file.  I.e. Only the base filename is
	   used.

	o  Only one <HR> after the H1 subject in messages will appear
	   if no message header fields are printed.

	o  Added recognition of the following content-types in
	   mhexternal.pl:

		application/mac-binhex40

	o  Added a extras/ directory containing useful programs for
	   MHonArc.  See README in the directory for information on
	   the programs contained in there.

	o  To support -rmm, MIME filters now return an array.  The
	   first array value is the HTML for the message, and any other
	   array values are filenames of files generated by the
	   filter.  This allows MHonArc to know of any extra files that
	   must be deleted when a message is removed.

	o  Some routines from the main mhonarc source file have been
	   moved into a separate librarys: readmail.pl, mhdb.pl,
	   mhutil.pl

	o  The default URL to the documentation is now,

		http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html

	   The old URL,

		http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.doc.html

	   is still valid.

	o  There's probably other stuff, but I cannot remember.
